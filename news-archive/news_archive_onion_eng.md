#### 2009-10-09: Onion and garlic prices spiralling

Porimol Palma
Onion price witnessed around 50 percent hike to sell between Tk 30 and Tk 44 per kg while the price of garlic continued to show an upward trend with around eight percent increase in a month.

Importers said a fall in production of garlic in China and onion price hike in India following heavy flooding in the country's southern states recently affected the prices of these two items. Garlic price went up by around 200 percent in a year selling between Tk 70 and Tk 110 a kg.
The price of imported onion, which was between Tk 18 and Tk 25 a kg in early September, has now shot up to Tk 30 to Tk 36. This is 53.49 percent rise in a month, according to the report of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

Besides, the price of local variety of onion, which was between Tk 36 and Tk 38 per kg in early September, has now shot up to Tk 38 to Tk 44 with 10.81 percent rise, said TCB that prepared the report based on their visits to the city's Karwan Bazar, New Market, Hatirpool, Moulavi Bazar, Sutrapur, Fakirapool, Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Shahjahanpur, Malibagh, Jatrabari, Shantinagar, Kochukhet and Mohakhali markets.

Moulavi Bazar Traders Association General Secretary Golam Mawla said recent flooding in Indian southern states hampered transport of onion ultimately affecting its price in the local market.

“As onion price went up in Patna of Bihar, we now import from south Indian states. The onion price in southern states also increased because of floods,” he said.

Dhaka Metropolitan Agriculture Products Importers' Association General Secretary Khandaker Babul of Shyambazar said traders in the wholesale market of the city were badly affected, as huge amount of imported onion got rotten during the vacation of Eid and Puja.

“Traders were compelled to sell onion at negligible prices during the vacation. They are now selling onion at higher prices to make up for the losses,” he told The Daily Star yesterday.

Meanwhile, imported garlic price went up to Tk 70 to Tk 75 a kg yesterday from Tk 65 to Tk 75 a kg early September. Garlic was sold between Tk 28 and Tk 32 a kg the same time last year.

The price of local variety of garlic on October 8 last year was only Tk 30 to Tk 34 per kg, which is now between Tk 90 and Tk 110 a kg, an increase by 212.50 percent, according TCB.

“The garlic price was `$360` to `$400` per metric ton just four months back, but it has gone up to around `$1,050` now in China,” said Khandaker Babul, a garlic importer in Shyambazar.

He said they imported garlic ahead of Eid-ul Fitr at `$940` per metric ton, but it was sold at lower prices because of more supply.

“As the price in China went high, traders are afraid of importing more garlic,” Babul said, adding that this is the reason why garlic price is now high.
China witnessed around 30 percent fall in garlic production this year, according to the US-based online newspaper--The Produce News.

#### 2009-10-13: Onion import falls as India raises price
A Correspondent, Benapole

Import of onion through Benapole land port has decreased as the Indian government has raised the price of the produce because of a poor harvest and supply.Onion import through the port is gradually falling, as no new letter of credit (L/C) is being opened now, said officials.

Earlier local businessmen used to import onion from India through different land ports at a rate of `$270 per tonne. But the price has been fixed at $355` from October 6. In the last 8-9 days 1,612.72 tonnes of onion were imported through Benapole port.

Massive flood and excessive rainfall in Indian southern states have damaged onion crop and supply.

Indian commerce ministry and its affiliated body have reportedly started discouraging export of onion to Bangladesh.

Bangladeshi traders apprehend that the price would not become normal before Eid-ul Azha although Indian exporters say the situation is normal.

#### 2011-01-25: Onion: a pungent cry
Khondoker Md Shoyeb

Narayan Chandra Saha

Indian onions would only be included in salads at five-star hotel dining here if Bangladesh could meet demand for the commodity with local produce. The country would not have to sacrifice the timeless tastes of Bangladeshi cuisine because of cooking with the less-in-flavour Indian onions.
This is what Narayan Chandra Saha, an onion importer at Shyambazar in Old Dhaka, feels. He was speaking to The Daily Star on the recent hike in onion prices and its current market scenario.
The businessman pointed at the recent floods in Indian states for the hike. “The floods once again showed us how dependent we are on Indian onions.”
Local onions are better than Indian ones, and are more expensive as well. Import makes the balance, Saha said. “If there were no floods, the import of onions would not have been hampered and there would not be any price spiral.”
Nearly 80 to 100 trucks laden with Indian onions entered Bangladesh every day since the end of March through the Benapole, Bhomra, Hili and Sonamasjid land ports, he said. On the other hand, nearly 200 tonnes of local onions come to Dhaka from different districts in Bangladesh.
Local and Indian onions are usually priced at Tk 18-20 a kilogram and Tk 20-22 a kilogram this season, Saha said. “But prices of local onions went up to Tk 70 a kg in the absence of its Indian options, thanks to an export ban by the Indian agriculture ministry from December 20, 2010, after the floods.”
"The ban influenced Bangladeshi growers to harvest bulb onions even before maturity, in hopes of making some early profit, pulling the onions production down to 8 maunds from 12 maunds.”
Bangladesh is not rich in onions. The product is farmed in a few districts, like Faridpur, Rajbari, Ishwardi, Shariyatpur, Kushtia, Pabna, Madaripur, Meherpur, Chuadanga and Manikganj.
Because of the ban, local onions are now sold in the market. “We have already finished selling the onions that came from Ishwardi. We sold three fourths of the onions from Pabna. Now, onions from Faridpur are ruling the market.” “But the best onions will come from Meherpur this season after 15 to 20 days,” Saha said.
“The bulb onions were never treated as regular onions as those taste much lighter than other varieties and cannot be stored for more than 10 days.”
The storage variety of onions will appear in March and can be found in markets till December. These onions have a storage life of 8 to 10 months.
The storage onions provide 4-times better produce than bulb onions, he said. “People are selling storage onions at around Tk 1,500 a maund, almost two times more than the purchasing price of Tk 650-700 a maund last year.”
Bangladesh can hardly meet its five-month demand for onions with local produce. Moreover, business-people release the onions in stages, depending on market prices.
This season, storage onions may be priced at Tk 800-900 a maund, while a large portion will be stored, he said.
The storage onions are rain-sensitive. “There will be a huge loss if it rains in February, as growers will not get a second chance to farm the variety again this season.”
Bulb onions are usually found till mid March, while storage onion production starts at the end of March. "If there are no natural calamities in the next 2 to 3 months, onion production will be huge this time."
But Bangladesh should work for self-sufficiency in onions, Saha recommended. The government could restrict Indian onions from entering Bangladesh for at least two to three months, when local variety hits the markets, he said. “This will ensure good prices for farmers and inspire them to allocate more lands to produce the vegetable next year.”
“Our agriculture ministry should actively work to find out why all the 64 districts in Bangladesh can't produce onions. But the government should think about the consequences of what would happen if the Indian floods did not occur in the peak season of our local onions.”

#### 2011-02-11: India lifts onion export ban
Pallab Bhattacharya, New Delhi

India yesterday decided to lift a ban on onion exports after the product's prices crashed and triggered protests.
Empowered Group of Ministers on Food headed by Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee took the decision.
The Indian government had banned onion exports on December 20 last year. Onion prices had touched Rs 70-80 a kg then. India will allow shipments of onions at a minimum export price of `$600` per tonne.

#### 2011-04-27: Now bumper onion brings tears to farmers
Ahmed Humayun Kabir Topu, Pabna

Onion farmers across Bangladesh got bumper yields this year because of favourable weather conditions, but low market prices hurt them.
The crop witnessed the highest acreage this year across Bangladesh but farmers have failed to receive even the minimum price that prevailed last year. They are facing the same fate as the potato farmers do. Bumper output does not bring them any extra hope, but extra pain.
Meanwhile, farmers in Pabna have achieved remarkable success in onion cultivation, officials said. Although a majority of the onions produced in the country come from Pabna, the farmers in the district are more frustrated over poor market prices.
According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in the district, a total of 36,040 hectares of land in 9 upazilas in the district were brought under onion cultivation this year although the target was 33,100 hectares. Each hectare produced at least 10 to 10.5 tonnes of onions, while the amount was 8.5 tonnes last year, officials said.
“We fixed a target of 9 tonnes but farmers saw optimum production this year,” Md Shahin, a development officer of DAE in Pabna, told The Daily Star.
At least 3.8 lakh tonnes of onions are expected this year; it was 3.4 lakh tonnes last year. The weather was suitable and there were no natural disasters, Shahin said.
Md Eunus Ali, director of the field service wing of Agriculture Extension Directorate in Dhaka, said Pabna has been the highest onion producing district in the last few years because of its good soil quality. About 20-25 percent of the total onion produced in Bangladesh comes from this district, he said. A total of 1.7 lakh hectares in 64 districts were brought under onion cultivation, expecting over 15.3 lakh tonnes of onions this year.
“Final reports have not come in as yet as harvests are still underway in some districts. But good weather is the main reason behind bumper outputs this year, he said.
Ali said, over 15 lakh tonnes of onion would be produced in 64 districts this year although the total production was 14 lakh tonnes last year.
Of the onion producing districts, Rajshahi, Rajbari and Faridpur are also showing signs of good onion outputs, he added.
He said the farmers are mainly unhappy over the low prices.
Md Abdul Jabbar, an onion farmer in the Durgapur village of Sujanagar upazila in Pabna, said, “I spent at least Tk 13,000 to Tk 14,000 on each bigha of land to produce onions, with a target of producing over 25 to 30 maunds. But poor market prices have shattered our dreams. Even after a long struggle, I cannot make any profit.”
“My three brothers and I cultivated onions on at least 200 bighas this year, spending at least Tk 3 lakh. We got about 6,000 maunds of onion, but incurred losses for low prices. We sold onions at Tk 550 to Tk 600 a maund. At the end of the harvest season, we won't get more than Tk 3-Tk 3.25 lakh.”
Jabbar said he could get back his investment, but could not make any profit.
Marginal farmers are bearing the brunt, he added.
“We sold onions at Tk 750 to Tk 800 a maund last year. But market prices this year are dismal because of a large output.”
Many other marginal onion farmers in the district are sharing the same fate.
“I cultivated onions on a few bighas of land by taking loans from others. I spent about Tk 13,000 on each bigha. I just barely got back the production cost. The high prices last year inspired me to cultivate the crop this year.”
Jabbar said the government should take steps to control the market.
Criticising government policies, the farmers said they were deprived at a time when the crop witnessed a bumper output.
The Pabna farmers also demanded the government make arrangements so that they are able to store onions, like potatoes.
Jabbar said: “Pabna is the highest onion producing district. We did not get good prices and neither do we have any facilities to preserve the crop. So, we are bound to sell our crops to avert losses."
The government should take steps to preserve the crop so that the farmers can get the right prices at a suitable time, said the farmer.

#### 2011-09-12: Onion prices rise on Indian ban
Staff Correspondent

Prices of onions jumped yesterday, buoyed by a ban by India on the export of the item, traders said.
The price of onions rose to Tk 36-45 a kilogram yesterday from Tk 32-42 on Thursday in markets in Dhaka, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
The wholesale prices of onions also rose.
“There is a lack in the supply of onions in the market. Those who are still hoarding stocks are reluctant to sell as well,” said Idris Ahmed, owner of a wholesale store, Dhaka Baniyalaya at Shyambazar.
He said onions were selling at Tk 35-36 a kilogram at the wholesale market of Shyambazar yesterday. Prices went up since Friday afternoon, after news of the ban by India, said Ahmed.
The prices of locally produced onions also rose, influenced by the move by India, he added.
This is the second time in less than a year that India restricted onion exports to curb the hike in prices, according to Indian news reports.
On September 8, an Indian ministerial panel banned onion exports following a steep rise in prices, reports Reuters, quoting Food Minister KV Thomas. The restriction came in effect on Friday. “We will review the ban every fortnight," said Thomas.
Bangladesh meets much of its local demand for onions by importing it from the neighbouring country.
Since Saturday, 80 onion-laden trucks entered Bangladesh till yesterday afternoon, our Chapainawabganj correspondent reports.
No shipment took place at the Bhomra Land Port yesterday. The trucks carrying onions that came to the Ghojadanga Land Port on the Indian side returned without shipment, our Sathkhira correspondent reports.
Babul Hasnat Durul, an onion importer at Sona Masjid, said their suppliers are not shipping onions against the previously placed orders by Bangladeshi importers.
“We are worried. If onions are not exported against the already opened letters of credit (LCs), we will incur losses,” said Durul.
The LCs came to a halt following the ban on exports, said Islam of the C& F Agents Association.
The disruption in supply from India led to the hike in the prices of locally produced onions, said Mohammad Aminul Islam, an onion wholesaler at Karwan Bazar. He bought a 40 kilogram bag of onions from Pabna on Saturday at Tk 1,450, he said. Prices for the same stood at Tk 1,300-1,350 last week, he added.

#### 2013-02-04 Supply crunch hikes onion prices
Star Business Report

Onion prices shot up as much as Tk 9 a kilogram in the city markets due to supply disruption and escalating prices in India, the main import source.
Retailers sold onion at Tk 35-45 a kg yesterday, when a week ago it sold at Tk 28-36, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
In some stores and markets, onions are selling at Tk 50 a kg, according to data from the Department of Agricultural Marketing.
"Supply from the Bhomra land port, one of the major channels for onion import, has been on hold in the past two weeks," said Narayan Chandra Saha, an onion importer at Old Dhaka's Shyambazar, a wholesale point for onion.
The clearing and forwarding agent associations of the two countries' ports went on strike on January 20, demanding movement of heavy vehicles between the two ports.
Earlier, lorries could enter the Bhomra port, but it has been banned of late due to poor condition of the bridge.
"We hope the [strike] will be dissolved shortly and prices would come down to normal in the domestic market," said Md Alamgir Hossain, an onion importer at Bhomra.
The rising prices of onion in India, the country's main source of the essential cooking ingredient, are also to blame for the price hike.
India has seen the prices soar in recent times due to insufficient supply arising out of dry weather in its onion-producing areas.
In a letter, Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, asked Sharad Pawar, India's agriculture minister, to curb onion exports â€œto bring about an improvement in onion ratesâ€.
Helal Sikder, a salesman at Rajib Bainjavandar at Shyambazar, said prices of each kg of imported onion now stand at Tk 36 in Dhaka.
But the harvest of early varieties of onion has begun in Faridpur, one of the major onion producing areas. â€œIt will cause prices to fall,â€ he said.
Saha also expects the prices to drop in ten days' time on the back of increased arrival of imported onions and fresh harvest.

#### 2013-08-19: India taking back onion from land ports
Indians put pressure on Bangladeshi traders to hike prices
Star Business Report

India taking back onion from land ports
Indian exporters are taking back Bangladesh-bound onion from their land ports and selling them at higher prices in West Bengal, Bangladeshi importers said yesterday.
“Even yesterday large shipments of onion were waiting at Indian land ports to enter Bangladesh, but those were taken back and sold in the local [Indian] markets at higher prices,” said Khandaker Babul, general secretary of Dhaka Mohanagar Krishiponno Amdanikarok Association, a platform of perishable goods importers.
The prices of onion at the ports were settled at `$330-$350` a tonne a few weeks ago, before the Indian government set the minimum export price of the cooking ingredient at `$650` on Wednesday to tame its market.
“Now the Indian exporters are putting pressure on the Bangladeshi traders to hike the prices,” said Helal Uddin, vice-president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
They spoke at a press briefing after a meeting of the onion importers and traders with the commerce ministry at the secretariat, against the backdrop of the spiralling prices fuelled by a supply crunch in India.
Commerce Secretary Mahbub Ahmed said they are now looking into options to import onion from Myanmar through Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
“I hope the prices will come down soon,” he said.
The secretary also blamed the sudden price hike on some hoarders among farmers and traders.
The annual demand for onion is 20 lakh tonnes in Bangladesh, he said. “We have adequate stocks, but the prices went up due to a hike in the Indian market,” he said.
An additional secretary of the commerce ministry will go to Chittagong and Cox's Bazar soon to facilitate import of onion from Myanmar through Teknaf land port, Ahmed said.
The ministry's market monitoring teams will also launch drives to crack down on hoarders and price manipulators, he added.
Our Dinajpur correspondent adds: The Indian customs yesterday stopped exporting onion to Bangladesh through Hili land port without any prior notice.
Importers at the port alleged that Indian customs raised the price of onion to `$650 a tonne from $400` on Saturday.
The Indian customs officials told the Bangladeshi traders that they would not release the onion at `$400` settled in the letters of credit earlier. Before the Eid festival, the price was `$300`.
Due to the sudden decision, at least 100 onion-laden trucks got stranded inside the Indian territory, said Mazedul Haque, assistant commissioner at Hili land port.

#### 2013-09-19: Price rockets due to trading racket
Finds study
Reaz Ahmad

Price rockets due to trading racket
The steep rise in onion prices is not just the fallout of supply cut from India, but also an artificial supply shortage created by a nexus of traders, said a study by a food policy research think-tank.
“The market supply of onion in Bangladesh declined not only because of the reduction in imports from India, but also due to local traders taking advantage of the situation by cutting the supplies of their stored onions to the market in order to make extra profits,” found the study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (Ifpri).
The report was made public at a time when prices of both the homegrown and imported onions resurged after a brief respite for just a couple of weeks.
Yesterday, onion was selling at Tk85 a kilogram in Dhaka markets against the previous week's price of Tk62. The current price range is even higher than what it had been in mid-August (Tk80 a kg), according to statistics of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). A year ago, the highest price of onion was only Tk32 a kg.
Price rockets due to trading racket
Market sources said the downtrend in prices was short-lived (in between late August and early September) as some traders took full advantage of the state-run TCB's too late and too little imports from Myanmar and China.
“The prices of onion surged again because traders told us that the first consignment of government imports has already been exhausted,” said Mohammad Manik, a wholesaler of onion at Karwan Bazar.
The Ifpri study identified several factors for the sudden rise in onion prices in July-August and the subsequent short-lived downtrend and resurge in recent weeks.
Ifpri representative to Bangladesh Akhter U Ahmed feared that the “onion traders' cartel” would push the prices further up in the days leading to mid-October when the demand for the item would be at its peak with the Muslims celebrating the Eid-ul-Azha.
Talking to The Daily Star yesterday, Akhter, the lead author of the study, said the government needed to facilitate more imports from non-Indian markets and create an enabling environment at home so that more traders can get in breaking free the current oligopoly.
“Explore ways to establish an enabling environment that promotes more participation in the onion trade and guards against excessive stockpiling,” recommended the Ifpri study, Sudden onion price surge in Bangladesh: A situation analysis for policy.
Contacted, additional secretary at the commerce ministry Monoj Kumar Roy said government agencies have been on alert against onion hoarding. He could not say readily how much of a planned 5,000 tonnes emergency import has actually reached.
Monoj, however, confirmed that the fair price sale of onion (Tk47 a kg), which was launched in late August and suspended abruptly, would resume from September 22 as a last resort to tame the price resurge during the Eid-ul-Azha.
Akhter U Ahmed said the government needed to promptly mobilise a bigger volume of imports, at least 10,000 tonnes, if it wanted to offset the prospect of an even bigger surge in onion prices during the upcoming Eid season.
He also suggested the country must lessen its import-dependency in onion as it has already experienced a very encouraging growth in domestic onion production from a mere 1.5 lakh tonnes in 2001-02 to 1.16 million tonnes in 2011-12.
“A little more investment on onion can easily make Bangladesh self-sufficient and it would no longer require imports,” he mentioned adding that only four percent of the total farming community in the country now grows almost three-fourths of the current total onion requirements in less than one percent of the total arable land.
India produces around one-quarter of the global onion supply, second only to China, and historically, it has been the only source of onion imports for Bangladesh. Because of this, when recent drought in India's main onion production zones led to major crop losses, onion imports in Bangladesh decreased giving the “onion cartel” an opportunity to make windfall profit out of consumers' misery.
As the government, said Akhter, announced on August 17 its decision to import onion from Myanmar, the market price of onion began to drop. But the insignificant import volume and India's move of procuring onion from Pakistan prompted the onion cartel in Bangladesh to push up the price again, he added.
A bad weather forced India to hike its onion export price from `$250 a tonne to $650` and lately India decided to go for imports.
As onion is a key ingredient in most Bangladeshi meals, its sudden price spurt in the domestic market since early July has raised concerns in consumers and the government, noted the Ifpri study.
While the price surge hits low-income consumers the hardest, it can also become an important political issue, mentioned the report citing the example in India, where onion prices were regarded as the decisive factor in the 1998 state elections in Delhi and Rajasthan and were responsible for bringing down the central government in 1980.
Upon request from the USAID mission in Bangladesh, the Washington-based think-tank Ifpri and its Bangladesh Policy Research and Strategy Support Programme (PRSSP) team conducted the analysis.
MINISTRY WORKING ON ONION PRICES
Eighty percent work of the commerce ministry is now concentrated on onions, Commerce Minister GM Quader told parliament yesterday.
Responding to a scripted question from ruling party lawmaker Shahida Tarekh, he said, “We are discussing with the people concerned and communicating with Myanmar, China and Pakistan for importing onions.”
The higher prices of onions had made the local importers shaky and subsequently, they cut imports from India, resulting in a hike in prices after Eid-ul-Fitr, added Quader.
Queried about whether the consumers would face a similar hike in onion prices ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the minister said they were very alert now to make sure that there was no scarcity of onions at that time.

The state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) sells onions for Tk 55 per kilo from a truck in the capital's Abdul Gani Road near Bangladesh Secretariat yesterday. The move came after a sudden jump of the price by Tk 30 to Tk 105 yesterday from Tk 75 a kg on October 4 on retail markets, according to the TCB. Photo: Focus Bangla

There is no let-up in onion price hike as consumers continue to pay through their noses for this essential commodity particularly at a time when its demand is the highest during the Eid-ul-Azha.
With the latest jump in prices of onion, the government yesterday asked the deputy commissioners of all the 64 districts to monitor and report immediately any artificial jacking up of the prices.
According to a market report of the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), prices of onion soared by Tk 30 a kg within a week from Tk 75 on October 4 to Tk 105 yesterday.
The TCB said around this time last year, onion was selling at Tk 22-35 a kg.
"Local onion is available throughout the country. Besides, traders are importing it from different countries. There is no reason why the prices of onion should rise like this overnight," additional commerce secretary Monoj Kumar Roy told The Daily Star yesterday.
The district administration throughout the country has been instructed to watch out for any ulterior move to raise the prices of onion during the Eid, he said.
Official sources noted that the government has become perplexed by the erratic behaviour of traders. "It appears that everyone out in the market is trying to reap maximum benefits out of a crisis," one of them added.
Surprisingly, the latest price hike of onion took place overnight after the traders reassured the government of no more increase in its prices at a stakeholders' meeting on Thursday.
Asked about this, General Secretary of Dhaka Mohanagar Krishiponno Amdanikarok Association Khandaker Babul, said, "Imports are on although there are some problems due to a few days' halt in land port activities on the other side of the border [India] due to [Durga] Puja. But traders of locally grown onion took advantage of this and decreased the supply of onion in the hope of making more profits."
Babul said that efforts were on to enhance supply of "hoarded" onion in the market, and its prices would go down before the Eid.
In July-August, prices of onion started going up following reports that    bad weather affected production of onion in India, a main source of Bangladesh's onion import. To offset the price hike in domestic market, the TCB initially started selling onion at fair price (Tk 47 a kg) from trucks at designated places and then again at Tk 55 a kg after further price hike in the international market.
There are, however, allegations of TCB dealers not selling the fair price onion in other divisional headquarters except in Dhaka. The DCs have been also asked to monitor sale of the TCB-supplied onion.
Last month the Washington-based food policy think-tank -- International Food Policy Research Institute (Ifpri), reported that the steep rise in onion prices was not just the fallout of supply cut from India, but also an artificial supply shortage created by a nexus of traders.
“The market supply of onion in Bangladesh declined not only because of the reduction in imports from India, but also due to local traders taking advantage of the situation by cutting the supplies of their stored onions to the market in order to make extra profits,” it said.
Contacted over the phone, Ifpri representative to Bangladesh Akhter U Ahmed said the TCB should have intervened in the market in a big way to tackle the traders' nexus. Commerce ministry official Monoj Kumar Roy agreed, but added in the same breath that the TCB needed to be strengthened to go the extra miles.
Both Akhter and Monoj also said that "panic buying" by consumers also contributed to the price rise of onion.

#### 2015-05-25 (Quora) Why do onion prices in India fluctuate so often (compared to other vegetables) and how is this significant in the economy?

Since this is a broad question and the answer lies not in one single explanation, I have divided the answer in many sections, the titles to which are highlighted in bold, caps and underlined.

The sections are:
--Onion and it's significance
--Onion, it's use and its increasing demand
--Onion and its erratic supply - how seasonality affects onion prices
--Onion and its erratic supply - how government and man-made factors affect onion prices
--Onion and its erratic supply - how supply chain structure affects onion prices (including 3 sub-sections 1. statewise production share and its problems and 2. structure of the onion supply chain and 3. the example of Karnataka's Agricultural Market)
--The Solution

To get a better more complete understanding of the onion market and how pricing works, I recommend reading the entire article.

ONION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE

Onion ranks third in the world production of major vegetables.
In India, however, it's significance is defined not only by its essential role in the diets of millions of Indians, rich and poor, but also the resulting political significance.

Onion is the only vegetable that can bring down a government from power. As history has shown, onion prices brought down the central govt. from power in 1980. Then again in 1998, the BJP lost majority in major states due to onion prices while in 2010, the Congress-led ruling government was forced to ban exports and start importing onions to prevent street protests against rising prices.

ONION AND ITS USE AND ITS INCREASING DEMAND

From North to South and East to West, it is used in many ways:

It's pureed, sautéed and added to many vegetable, dal or meat preparations


Even used to garnish in meals,


Eaten raw as a salad,


Used as a dip,


Fried as fritters and crisps.


You cannot substitute it with any other vegetable, so demand for onions is completely inelastic.

Besides, as per  NSSO data, monthly per capita consumption of onions across all of India has been increasing due to many reasons including lifestyle changes. Between years 2004-05 and 2009-10, the consumption of onions increased 32% and 18% in rural and urban India respectively while production of onions in India between these two years increased almost 90%.


 Additionally, there is also a lot of demand of Indian Onion in the world. Onion is mainly exported from India in the form of dehydrated onion, canned onion and onion pickle. Dehydrated onions are considered as a potential product in world trade and India is the second largest producer of dehydrated onions in the world.

So, unlike regular food grains, onion is also being cultivated in many regions of India mainly for commercial purpose, not for home consumption (subsistence) purpose only. This explains why government in the recent years has tried to restrict export of onions from time to time to sustain domestic demand. Whether this move is helpful in regulating prices in the long run is a separate topic for debate discussed later.

So, I think it is safe to say that with onions, increasing high inelastic demand is a big factor yet it cannot be the only reason why market prices of onions is so volatile.

ONION AND IT'S ERRATIC SUPPLY - HOW SEASONALITY AFFECTS ONION PRICES

Onion is a cool season crop. It is grown during winter and harvested before the real hot season begins.

In India, onion is grown in three crop seasons: Rabi (Summer Crop), Kharif (Early Winter Crop) & (Late Winter Crop) and the harvest times of each crop are as follows:



During the period between June and September (Monsoon season in India), no onions are harvested (but kharif seeds are sown during this period) and demand is sustained by the summer (rabi) crop, which is harvested in March and April, is stored and supplied to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif (early winter) crop by mid-September onwards.

The summer (rabi) crop comprises approximately 60% of the total production of onions in India and has a shelf life of around 6-7 months only. Mainly, the Rabi onion may be stored till October-November and is made available steadily for domestic as well as export markets.

So, as per general seasonal trend, price of onion tend to increase and reach at peak during September to November and drops in January-March with the arrival of the late kharif crop.

And  mostly when the winter (kharif) crop harvest is poor, the onion supply goes down and prices spike during winters. It has been observed that the main Kharif yields' dependency on rains disturbs the regular production and amounts to heavy losses of the produce as well as of farmer’s incomes.

ONION AND IT'S ERRATIC SUPPLY - HOW GOVERNMENT AND MAN-MADE ACTIONS AFFECT ONION PRICES

Sometimes, price rise (retail price rise in particular) may also be due to delayed arrival of onions in the market, delays may be due to natural causes or man-made caused by activities like hoarding, supply chain mismanagement and government actions plus also due to general inflation of fuel prices.

The government controls the prices of Onions through various measures like setting 'Minimum Export Price' (MEP) and including onions in the 'Essential Commodities Act' while reducing stock holding limits.

For example recently in the year 2014, on March 3, the central government had removed MEP of onions due to rise in kharif production. But, unseasonal rainfall and hailstorm had hit the Nashik (Maharashtra) district in March that badly affected the quality of summer onions. As a result, the arrival of good quality onions in the market was up to 10%, while the remaining 90% was of poor and medium quality. After the domestic prices rose due to scarcity of onions, the government again introduced MEP of $300 per tonne on June 17 and increased it to $500 a tonne on July 2 to control the prices in the domestic market. After pressure from farmers, who were forced to sell their produce below cost, the central government reduced the MEP to $300 a tonne on August 21.

It may be noted that Maharashtrais the biggest producer of Onions in India and Lasalgaon (town in Nashik District in Maharashtra) is the largest hub of onions in Asia. Nashik district also contributes 80% of the total onion export of the country. The central government policies for stabilizing onion prices intra-country led to a decline in exports but the price consumers had to pay was inconsistent across various states due to other logistic issues.

ONION AND IT'S ERRATIC SUPPLY - HOW THE SUPPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE AFFECTS PRICES

One important thing to note in the case of perishable items like onions is that, the most important fall-out of a weak monsoon is not truly reduced food supplies and higher food prices, but rather the expectations and fears that weaker rains will likely cause. Unfortunately, market expectations often tend to be self-fulfilling.

And these market expectations of traders matter because about 97% of the country’s onion harvest is sold in 50 major onion market yards, regulated under the APMC Act.

Each state has its own version of the model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act (APMC Act). This determines the market structure—who can buy and sell to whom, where, when and the charges and taxes to be paid at each stage.

The government's swift action with a slew of measures to try to stave off market overreactions, such as setting minimum export prices, using public distribution systems to distribute high-priced food items, and coaxing states to respond firmly to hoarders has often helped the onion sector but the big discussion remains that government interference only helps cure the symptoms of the problems prevalent in the system and not the problem itself.

To better understand these problems, one has to understand:

STATEWISE PRODUCTION SHARE AND ITS PROBLEMS

Per 2014-15 production figures, major onion producing states in India are Maharashtra(30.29%), Karnataka (10.98%), Madhya Pradesh (15.33%), Andhra Pradesh (3.44%), Bihar (6.74%), Gujarat (9.56%), Rajasthan (3.07%), Haryana (4.33%), Tamil Nadu (2.69), Uttar Pradesh (2.14) & Odisha, Telengana & West Bengal (2% each) which together account for a little over 90 percent of total production.


Three major producers of Onions in India Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh together hold 60% of the area under onion cultivation and contribute to over 55% of the onion production in the country. Per 2011 census, these three states support at least 20% of the population.

In Maharashtra for example (estimate based on 2004-05 NSSO data), the states' own consumption was roughly 24% of its production while 40% of its production was exported and 2% processedand the remaining was wastage. Per some data, Maharashtra is also supplying onions to other Indian states including the north and east of the country but specific figures are unavailable.

If we study the production growth patterns of these three states, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have both increased production in the last few years while production growth in Karnataka has been inconsistent.


Maharashtra is the top producer of Onions and its production has increased over the years, however, erratic weather, volatile market price, lack of adequate storage and market infrastructure have caused instability in production through preventing the farmers in taking the optimal decision on allocation of area and raising of farm productivity.

Although, productivity of onion has improved from last decade, still onion production is mainly driven by acreage allocation. As onion is irrigated crop and Maharashtra is endowed with relatively less irrigation potential, increasing production through scaling up area for onions may not have been possible without reducing the acreage under other important high value crops. So, it is advantageous for the producers and supply chain managers to sell onions at a higher market price.

To better understand who benefits from the higher price of onions let us understand the structure of the supply chain.

STRUCTURE OF THE ONION SUPPLY CHAIN

6 of the top ten onion markets are in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have 1 each. So, more than half of India’s daily arrivals pass through these 10 markets.

Typically, thousands of small farmers bring their produce to a small number of licensed commission agents, traders and exporters at their nearest market. Here, quantity is what counts, not quality. When a large number of farmers are trying to sell to a small number of licensed buyers, they have little bargaining power. They have no access to price information in other markets or about the pipeline of arrivals into the same market.

Per some estimates farmers receive at best 45 paisa from every rupee spent by the consumer. Rest is pocketed by traders, CAs, transporters and retailers.

The traders and commission agents in every onion mandi (market) are an old boys’ club, where membership is hereditary and controlled by an intricate system of marriages and alliances. Collusion and price fixing are rampant but no one will expose his brother.

Onions bought from these wholesale traders/commission agents flow into grocery stores to serve over a billion consumers. There are also no laws to prevent retailers from charging what they please.

The case of Maharashtra as reported in the 2014 NDTV report Maharashtra: How Political Ambitions Fuel Rising Onion Pricesclearly explains the flaws of the current Agricultural Market System.

The case of Delhi, as reported in With or without APMC delisting, its business as usual for traders, where fruits and vegetables were delisted from the APMC act also did not provide any long term solution to the problems of onion prices.

THE EXAMPLE OF KARNATAKA'S AGRICULTURAL MARKET.

In 2013, the Karnataka government also tried to remedy this situation by introducing large-scale agricultural marketing reforms through a new law that requires just one license to operate in all of its 500 regulated market yards. It also expanded the definition of a market yard so that even a warehouse can be treated as a market yard and farmers can sell at a warehouse near their farm and companies can also set up private market yards.

The idea behind this move is that more traders means more competition and better prices to farmers.

What is interesting to note here is that while the Karnataka's government focused it's efforts on reforming the agricultural market sector, its production declined drastically which is yet to be explained.

Onion production in Karnataka was estimated at 25.23 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 against 24.51 lakh tonnes in the previous year, however, production for the year 2012-13 was only 23.95 lakh tons, while 2013-14, the production dropped further to 20.65 lakh tons. Even though the dropping trend was reversed during 2014-15 by producing 21.25 lakh tons, not only the state has lost its position as the second highest producer of onions, the production of onions is 13.3% lower than the production of 2011-12 while the area under onion cultivation has reduced by 20.7% as compared to 2011-12.

Going back to Karnataka's agricultural marketing reforms, Karnataka also introduced an electronic market place that ensures that the quality and quantity of every bag of produce is entered into an online system as a farmer arrives at a mandi. Traders bid for each lot online (even by sms) and everyone can see the prices being offered.

Two major onion markets in the state, Gadag and Hubli, have adopted the system and the plan is to eventually link all the large market yards in Karnataka into one unified market with seamless price discovery, price dissemination and freedom to enter and exit.

However, per Oct 2014 news reports, the city of Bangalore which consumes around 300 tons of onions a day, receives nearly 10,000 tons a day from the North of Karnataka. While prices in the city reign between 2,500 to 3,500 per quintal, 200kms away in Central Karnataka (where 'Gadag' is one of the markets), farmers dump their onion produce in the market at 100-150 per quintal.

Most of this stock received in Bangalore is said to be supplied to other states including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and as far away as West Bengal. Some of it is said to even enter Bangladesh, the best quality onions picked up by exporters.

So, the move meant to bring in more transparency did not necessarily bring more efficiency into the system as prices were still dictated by traders.
Sometimes, what happens in Karnataka is that, Maharashtra traders often buy up onions in Karnataka markets when they sense a shortage.

One of the reasons attributed to the falling price is excessive rain this monsoon that has affected the quality of the yield and the merchants are not ready to pay more for the “wet” yield. Although the farmers admitted that their crop had been affected, they were of the opinion that “poor quality” was a mere ploy by merchants and brokers to reduce the price.

Historically if you see, Onion yield arriving at the APMC at Amaragol during August 2013, fetched Rs. 4,350 a quintal at higher end due to apprehension that there might be shortfall of supply in Nasik market due to poor monsoons.

One year later, the price at higher end is now Rs. 1,900 a quintal. Some say this is because of huge but poor quality arrivals in the market while some traders also explain that many farmers opted for onion cultivation hoping that they would get better price. Meanwhile, amid concerns about high prices, the government relaxed the norms for import of onion. And now due to huge arrivals and the relaxed import norms there is a slump in the price.

A point to note here is that since each state is like a kingdom when it comes to agriculture, the benefits of any state reforms will always be limited not only by State boundaries and the Central policy that rules the All India Market for Onions but also due to the demand and supply mechanics prevalent in other states.

THE SOLUTION

Some experts believe that the solution to most of India's problems (like the onion problem) lies in a law that unites our 29 states into single agricultural market.

A case in example for benchmark would be that of the European Union, which created a single agricultural market with 29 countries.

The EU adopted a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as part of the Treaty on European Union and this 'CAP' seeks to increase agricultural productivity, ensure livable wages for agricultural workers, stabilize agricultural markets, and assure availability of affordable produce throughout the EU.

Going back in history, when the Treaty of Rome established the common market in 1958, State intervention was a major feature of agriculture in the six founding Member States. If the principle of the free movement of goods was to apply to agricultural produce, ongoing State intervention notwithstanding, national intervention mechanisms which were incompatible with the common market had to be transferred to Community level; this is the basic rationale behind the establishment of the CAP.

The objectives of the CAP are both economic and social and are intended to safeguard the interests of producers and consumers.

Although the CAP has reduced conflicts within the EU, it has to some extent  led to the overproduction of certain commodities, including butter, wine, and sugar which has caused disagreements between the EU and some agricultural exporting nations (including the United States and Australia).
Nevertheless, the EU continues to develop and enhance its Agricultural sector  and the CAP has evolved significantly since it was created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy.

#### 2017-04-04 Low onion prices depress growers
    A good domestic harvest and an upsurge in imports have led to the drop in onion prices, much to the dismay of many growers who are now staring at losses.
    In growing areas, the prices of the most popular variety of locally grown onion have plunged to Tk 600 a maund (40 kilograms) from Tk 800-Tk 900 last year, according to traders. And it is the same story for the other varieties of onion.
    “This year's prices appear to be one of the lowest in years,” said Md Safar Ali Biswas, an onion grower at Chowgachhi village of Magura, one of the onion growing districts.
    For Biswas and many others in the southwest and northwest districts of Magura, Rajbari, Faridpur and Pabna, cultivating onion, an essential cooking ingredient, is one of the main sources of income.
    “At the going prices it will not be possible to bear our cost of living,” said Biswas, who has grown onion on one acre this season.
    He has to invest about Tk 13,000 to grow onion on 28 decimals of land, from where he can get 20-28 maunds of the vegetable. The sum does not include the cost of labour.
    “Growers here cultivate onion and garlic as cash crops, so the price fall has squeezed their income,” said Gobinda Saha, an onion trader in Rajbari district.
    The ample supply of onion amid a good local harvest and increased imports has brought down the prices, traders and farmers said.
    Onion imports soared 54 percent year-on-year to 7.14 lakh tonnes in the first half of fiscal 2016-17, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. “We suffer from low prices whenever imported farm produce floods the market,” said Abdul Hai, a small farmer in Pabna.
    Domestically, onion acreage and production have been on the rise since fiscal 2013-14 because of growers' renewed interest. In fiscal 2015-16, Bangladesh's onion production grew 2 percent year-on-year to 17.35 lakh tonnes. It was grown on 1.77 lakh hectares that year, according to BBS.
    Farmers planted onion on 2.10 lakh hectares this fiscal year, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension's estimates.
    Neighbouring India, a big source of the key cooking ingredient for Bangladesh, saw higher production this year.
    As a result, the prices in Bangladesh have remained low for the last several months, said Ratan Kumar Saha, an onion importer. Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market, expects the onion prices to remain low for the next couple of months.
    In Dhaka, the retail prices of locally grown onion stood at Tk 20-26 per kilogram yesterday, down from Tk 25-35 a year ago. The prices of imported onion were also below last year's level, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. To protect farmers, Mohammad Kamruzzaman, an onion trader in Sachilapur, Magura, urged the government to discourage imports during the harvesting period.

#### 2017-04-19  Onion prices on the rise again
    Onion prices are seeing a sprial as stockists have become active in buying the vegetable from growers to sell during the off season, said traders yesterday.

    The prices of the locally grown finest quality onion bulb have shot up to Tk 25 a kilogram from Tk 20 per kg two-three weeks ago in the growing districts.

    The vegetable traded between Tk 22-Tk 23 each kilogram at haats, up from Tk 15-Tk 17 two-three weeks ago, according to onion wholesalers. In Dhaka, retailers were selling onion, a key cooking ingredient, for as high as Tk 35 per kilogram yesterday, in contrast to Tk 28 a week ago.

    “The prices have gone up within a short time,” said Narayan Saha, proprietor of Nobin Traders, an onion wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital.

    The spike was influenced by the stockists' purchasing spree, he said.

    Traditionally, large farmers and a section of people at growing regions invest in freshly harvested onions so that they can profit from selling bulbs at higher prices during the off-season.

    “This practice has been going on for decades. I have been witnessing this business since my childhood,” said Gobinda Saha, a trader and stockist at Rajbari, one of the major growing districts.

    The supply has reduced because of increased stocking, he said. A large portion of onions have already gone towards stocking, said Md Aminul Islam, a wholesaler at Sathia, another growing district in northwest Pabna. “Stockists sometimes offer higher prices than us to grab onions,” he said.

    The excessive rainfall during the harvesting period has affected crops in the locality, according to Islam.

    “A large portion of the onions have become rotten as a result of the hailstorm. This is another reason for the spiral in prices,” he said. Farmers planted onion on 2.10 lakh hectares this fiscal year, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension's estimates. Influenced by the increased prices of locally grown onion and sluggish import early this month, the prices of imported bulbs also increased, Narayan said.

    In Dhaka, imported onions sold at Tk 22-Tk 26 each kg yesterday from Tk 20-Tk 22 a week ago.

    The locally grown ones sold at Tk 28-Tk 32 per kg at the retail level yesterday from Tk 24-Tk 28 a week ago, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. However, the prices are still lower than a year ago, TCB data showed.

    Bangladesh consumes 20 lakh tonnes of onion a year but it has to rely on imports due to inadequate production. Onion acreage and production have been on the rise since 2013-14 because of growers' renewed interest. But yields still are not enough to meet the demand.

    Onion production grew 2 percent year-on-year to 17.35 lakh tonnes in fiscal 2016. It was grown on 1.77 lakh hectares that year, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

#### 2017-07-13 (NDTV): Here We Go Again: Onion Prices Rise Due to Tight Supply
Onion prices at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Asia's biggest wholesale market for the staple, have started rising again due to supply concerns as the old stock has been exhausted, while the fresh kharif crop this year is expected to be 25-30 per cent lower.

Onion price, which had touched the record Rs 57 per kg in August at Lasalgoan, showed a declining trend after the Centre took several steps including hike in minimum export price and imports to boost domestic supply. It fell as low as Rs 25 per kg on October 16 at Lasalgaon.

However, prices started rising again beyond Rs 30 per kg in the last one week and are now ruling at Rs 32 per kg at Lasalgaon, as per the data maintained by the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF). A similar upward trend in wholesale onion prices was seen in Delhi and other mandis.


"This is a normal trend. The average wholesale onion price is ruling around Rs 30 per kg. At times, prices go up when arrivals are less, but rates come down as arrivals rise. We are keeping a close watch on rates," Nasik-based NHRDF Director R P Gupta told PTI.


He also said "there is no cause of worry" as more arrivals of fresh kharif crops are expected in the coming days from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Asked if there would be fall in 2015 kharif onion ouptut this year, Gupta said: "Overall kharif output would be same at last year's level. Although onion production in Maharashtra is expected to be lower due to poor rains, but that loss will be compensated in other states."


Meanwhile, farm experts and traders are projecting 25-30 per cent fall in this year's kharif output due to drought situation in the country's top two onion growing states -- Maharashtra and Karnataka. They also warned further spike in onion prices in the coming days as about 4 million tonnes of old stock has been sold off completely and new kharif crop is seen lower.


That apart, farmers are hesitant of getting fresh produce to mandis in the wake of extreme price volatility. They are waiting for correct price signal, they added. Onion production was 18.73 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June). Kharif onion output contributes 20 per cent to the overall production.


#### 2017-08-04: Onion dearer upon price hike in India - Daily Star
    Onion prices are soaring in the domestic market on the back of higher prices in India, the main source of supply of the essential cooking ingredient.
    Yesterday, people in Dhaka city had to foot as much as Tk 45 for a kilogram of onion, which they could get at Tk 40 a week ago, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
    Overall, the prices rose 39 percent to Tk 30-Tk 45 each kilogram yesterday from Tk 22-Tk 32 a month ago.
    “The market has been stable over the past several months. Suddenly, it became unstable because of a price spiral in India,” said Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market, one of the main depots of onion in the capital.
    The wholesale prices of Indian onion that were Tk 24-Tk 25 per kilogram on August 2 shot up to Tk 30 per kilogram yesterday, he said.
    Although Bangladesh annually produces more than 17 lakh tonnes of onion, it has to import a good amount to fully meet domestic requirements.
    In the first 11 months of last fiscal year, 14.13 lakh tonnes of onion were imported, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.
    Currently, onions are mainly imported from Nashik, a city in the northwest region of Indian state Maharashtra that is famous for its fresh agricultural produce.
    “Rainfall is to blame for the recent price hike,” said Md Asadul Islam, an importer at Bhomra Land Port that mainly handles onion imports, adding that the prices might go up further.
    Some Indian media outlets report that the prices of onion have risen in the neighbouring country over the last two weeks.
    The bullish sentiment in onion is backed by three factors: procurement by Madhya Pradesh government, heavy rainfall in Gujarat and expectations of a lower and delayed crop in Karnataka, reported The Economic Times yesterday.
    India had seen a bumper crop of onion in 2016, which led to prices tumbling below production costs. Farmers protested, forcing the Madhya Pradesh government to procure onions at Rs 8kg.
    Heavy rainfall in Gujarat reduced onion movement in the state.
    “We have good domestic production this year, but fluctuation in the prices of onion in the neighbouring country is influencing prices here” said Ratan Saha, who follows agri-commodity market, particularly onion and garlic.
    “This is because of our dependence on India for onion,” he said, adding that imports from Pakistan, Myanmar and China may rise for the soaring prices.

#### 2017-08-04 (IndianExperss): After tomato, surge in onion price likely

After tomatoes, it is onions that are threatening to turn the tide of low – actually negative — food inflation. On Thursday, the bulb was trading in Maharashtra’s Lasalgaon wholesale market at an average price of Rs 23 per kg. This was as against Rs 12.70 per kg just a day before which also saw the Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark repo lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6 per cent. Like in the case of tomatoes, the spike in onion prices has been sudden.

Since February 2016, onions were selling in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10 per kg, averaging as low as Rs 4.50-5.50 only this May-June. The modal or most-quoted rate at the country’s largest market for the bulb was Rs 5.70 per kg even as late as July 17. On July 26, it crossed Rs 10 and has more than doubled since then.

The interesting part about the price spiral is that it has come despite Lasalgaon recording about 22,000 quintals of onion arrivals on Thursday, compared to 13,000 quintals in the preceding two days. Also, this happens to be the month of Shravan in the Hindu calendar when onion consumption is supposed to be low. The bulb was, in fact, quoting in the Delhi market at an average of only Rs 13.75 per kg today although official arrivals there were just 14,263 quintals.

Omprakash Ratanlal Raka, a Lasalgaon-based onion trader and exporter attributed the firming up of prices to drought in Karnataka which has reported 26 per cent deficient rainfall so far in the current monsoon season. “The fresh kharif crop from Karnataka normally starts arriving towards mid-August and peaks by the first week of September. This time, there are reports of a 50 per cent dip in onion acreage in the state and that is what is driving prices”, he said. In Bengaluru, too, onion prices rose from Rs 15.80 to Rs 20.20 per kg today.

“The sudden price jump is only a result of demand and supply factors. Traders expect that the demand for onions from North India will pick up once the Shravan month gets over after Raksha Bandhan which is August 7. On the other hand, with the drought in Karnataka, there isn’t going to be any immediate source of supply till about mid-September”, said Nanasaheb Patil, director of the agriculture produce market committee at Lasalgaon.
The wholesale onion prices at Vashi Agricultural Produce Market Committee(APMC) are down by 1200 rupees a quintal since Tuesday. The reason: a glut of fresh stock that’s flooded the market from China, Pakistan and Egypt. A spike in fresh supply from Karnataka has also contributed to the fall in the wholesale rates.

Karnataka produces around 2.7 million tonnes (mt) out of India’s total annual onion output of 20-21 mt, making it the third largest after Maharashtra (6.5 mt) and Madhya Pradesh (2.8 mt). Onions are grown mostly during the kharif season with sowing in June-August following the monsoon rains. This crop arrives first in Karnataka from mid-August and in Maharashtra after mid-September.

In Maharashtra, farmers also plant a late-kharif crop during September-October, which is harvested in December-January, and rabi onion that is sown in November-December and harvested over March-April. The rabi crop, which is also grown in parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, is amenable to storage. Maharashtra farmers store this crop in structures called “kanda chawl” to prevent moisture causing the bulbs to sprout or rot. The stored onions are what feed the markets right until end-August when the fresh Karnataka crop would have arrived.

Traders estimate that Maharashtra farmers would have stored some 1.8 mt of onions from the last rabi crop which they sell in a staggered way. The corresponding figures for MP and Gujarat are in about 1.2 mt and 0.4 mt respectively. “This time, most of them made heavy losses on the stored onions, as prices ruled rock-bottom. In MP, the state government was actually forced to buy over 0.8 mt at Rs 8/kg. The farmers who hadn’t yet sold are obviously making money now”, a trader pointed out.

The high prices should induce farmers to sow more area in the ongoing kharif season. Till date, Maharashtra has reported only around 10,000 hectares of onion planting, as against the normal 30,000 hectares during kharif. Sowing has been lower partly because of the main Nashik belt receiving torrential rains during July and also un-remunerative prices. That could change in the coming weeks, with both prices and the weather looking up.

“We hope the Centre will not take steps like export ban and imposing stockholding limits, as in 2014 and 2015. High domestic prices will automatically put a brake on exports. Moreover, should not the farmer be entitled to some price increase after almost one-and-a-half years of losses?” asked Patil. India, in 2016-17, shipped out 2.42 mt on onions valued at Rs 3,106.50 crore. During the previous financial year, these amounted to 1.38 mt and Rs 3,097.21 crore, respectively.

    Some people decided to give their votes to BJP and accept their slavery. They forgot too much power to one party will lead to the dictatorship and will make the any party or government arrogant will harass normal people with their ordinance and misuse of law. Keep our voting power and have a Congress as a strong opposition so they can represent us at least as an opposition. Dont forget democracy is by the people, for the people and to the people.

    Ever since UPA came to power in 2004 a certain slippery party hopping politician was made the Agriculture minister a system has been devised by a mafia for a yearly shooting up of agricultural produce prices.

    Every year there has been problems on the prices of various vegetables specifically Onions as well tomato and may be more and the varion on prices leads to the problems of the house -wives. For every problem there exist a solution and we must work out on for solutions- Just few days earlier tomatoes were thrown on the road on the other the Farmers were deprived of even cost of cultivation,on the other for want of storage huge quan ies of onions were wasted or spoiled due to massive rains and definitely for want of storage facilities in addition important factor- Is our farmer getting the right returns for both tomatoes as well onions- the need of the hour is to improve on system- proper warehousing, allowing farmers to opt for marketing their product in the market may be through co-operative societies or formation of groups of farmers to opt for access of their product to the market. We must understand that most of the price variation is through middle man-what our farmer getting.

    India can deal with dual menace of onions and tomato crisis by a dual action plan. This should involve education and increasing capacity of processing industry. EDUCATION about onions- onion is mainly used for making dishes tastier. It is low in many vitamins, and one can actually live without it. Therfore, INDUSTRIAL processing of onions to make a ready made 'tarka mix', would not only boost profit but also produce a long lasting shelf-item capable of saving fuel cost. .....Tomatoes are a different item. A significant nutritive value lies in its raw consumption, rather than cooking. EDUCATION..People should eat it raw or make a fresh puree to be added last on top of food on plate. Frying or making taka from tomatoes destroys all of the vitamin C. Tomatoes have a small shelf life, but highly amenable to processing such as making tomato sauces popular all over India. Mexican salsa should be popularized for maximizing nutrition from the fresh (and expensive) onions and tomatoes.

        The menace of onion prices can be mitigated to a big extent by popularizing home growing of evergreen onions, which can keep producing onion greens for many years (5-10 years is not uncommon) with very little water requirements. Dried vegetable waste could be used as fertilizer. A shallow planter with a larger surface area in a semi shaded area may contain several dozen plants. One should only harvest the top green leaves, and leave couple of inches at the bottom.

#### 2017-10-12: Onion price shoots up
Supply short for land port closure, says importers’ leader
[Onion price shoots up]

Our Correspondent, Dinajpur

The price of onions shot up by Tk 8 to Tk 10 per kilogram in the retail and wholesale markets in the northern districts due to supply shortfall as the land ports were closed for Durga Puja and Ashura.

According to the land port authorities, import and export through land ports across the country remained closed for seven to 10 days for Durga Puja and Ashura. The ports reopened on October 3, they said.

As there was no import, onion price started soaring in the markets. Imported onion is being sold at Tk 40 per kg in the wholesale markets, whereas it was Tk 30 per kg two weeks ago. In the retail markets, the price is Tk 44 to Tk 45 per kg, traders said.

The price of locally produced onion has remained unchanged. It costs Tk 52 per kg in the retail markets, while it is Tk 48 per kg in the wholesale markets, they said.

Altaf Hossain, an onion trader of Bahadurbazar in the town, said he bought Indian onion from the importers at Hili land port in Hakimpur upazila of the district.

“I purchased onion at Tk 36 per kg from the importers,” he said, adding that there is no sign of price fall although trading through the land port resumed on October 3.

According to the customs department in Hili land port, around 1,500 tonnes of onion were imported through the port in the last seven days. Importers brought around 13,000 tonnes of onion from India in September and 16,000 tonnes in August through the port, said Protap Mallik, an official of Hili land port.

Harun Ur Rashid, president of Importers' Group of Hili Land Port, said onion price went up as there was no trade during the Durga Puja festival and Ashura.

Prices will come down in a couple of weeks as trading resumed around a week ago, he added.

#### 2017-10-29: Onion prices soaring - Daily Star
    Onion prices were nearly one and a half times that of a week ago, and local traders are blaming the hike on increased prices in India, the country's main source of import.

    Local variety was sold at as much as Tk 90 each kilogram in some kitchen markets of the capital yesterday, to the annoyance of people already hit hard by hiked rice price. Imported onions were sold at Tk 70 a kg.
    A week ago, prices of the vegetable were in the range of Tk 48 to Tk 60 per kilogram, according to the data of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
    The onion prices have gone up in Chittagong as well, reports our correspondent.

    “When will the price hit the Tk 100 level,” an annoyed shopper asked a seller after being told the price of locally-grown onion was Tk 80 a kg at the AGB Colony kitchen market in Dhaka.

    Refusing to give her name, she said she was aware of the recent price rise, but still was not expecting the onion price to be so high.
    Traders blamed the price hike on high cost of import from India, the main source of onion, due to crop loss in heavy rains in the neighbouring country. The cultivation of early varieties of onion here was also affected by downpour at a time when old stocks were depleted.

    Mosharaff Hossain, a trader of the kitchen market, said he had bought local and Indian onions at Tk 75 and Tk 54 a kg from Shyambazar wholesale market the day before.

    “Today I came to know that local onions are being sold at Tk 80-82 per kilogram at wholesale. I am yet to increase the prices because my purchase prices were lower,” he said yesterday.

    Onion is the latest item taking away a larger slice of the budget for grocery items, particularly of low income families who have already been experiencing squeezing of  their purchasing capacity for high prices of rice and vegetables. Very few vegetable items are now available in the markets at below Tk 50 per kilogram.

    “My income is not increasing, but prices of daily essentials are going up every day. We cannot afford the living cost,” said Md Faruk, a cobbler at Jamal Khan of Chittagong.

    Asadul Islam, an onion importer at Bhomra Land Customs Station, said the recent rainfall had damaged crops that were supposed to be harvested now in Nashik, one of India's main onion producing regions.

    “Growers there are selling onions from their stocks,” he said, adding that import costs, including transport and other expenses, amounted to Tk 50 per kilogram at Bhomra.

    Asked about the chances of traders hoarding the food item, he said onion is a perishable commodity and one could stock imported onions only for one or two days.

    Onion prices in the local markets largely depend on the prices in India, as Bangladesh does not produce enough to meet its annual requirement. Domestic production has risen in recent years though.

    Between July and August, two lakh tonnes of onion have been imported. The total import in fiscal 2016-17 was 15.01 lakh tonnes, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market, said prices were high in India, and the stock of locally-grown onion had almost been exhausted.

    Azizul Haque, a wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, said heavy rains had affected cultivation of early varieties of onion in the main producing districts such as Pabna. “Farmers are re-growing onions now after suffering from losses.”

    Mohammad Idris, proprietor of M/S Bacha Miah Saodagor, a wholesale shop at Khatunganj wholesale market, Chittagong, said onion prices had gone up in the local market due to increasing import costs.

    The price of Indian onion has increased by Tk 3 a kg since Friday last, he said, adding, “As Indian onion shares almost 80 percent of the local market, the prices of onion here are determined by ups and downs of that.”

    However, regulation of the retail market is necessary. The government should monitor the retail market           so that retailers cannot hike the prices illogically, Md Afsar Uddin, proprietor of Sonali Traders at Khatunganj wholesale market, Chittagong, said.

#### 2017-11-10: Prices of Indian onion drop in Ctg
[Prices of Indian onion drop in Ctg]
Dwaipayan Barua

For the first time in three weeks, Indian onion prices saw a downtrend at the Khatunganj wholesale hub in Chittagong in the last two days.

Prices of older stocks imported from India's Nasik region dropped by Tk 6-8 to Tk 42-45 per kilogramme (kg) as traders attempted to sell those off at the close of the season before those went bad.

Prices of recently harvested imports that have started to arrive also fell by around Tk 7 to sell at Tk 50 per kg.

However, the changes were yet to reach kitchen markets where the older varieties were selling at Tk 60 to Tk 65.

The local variety still remains pricey at around Tk 70 in wholesale and Tk 80-85 in kitchen markets, resulting in poor demand.

Demand for the older variety decreased noticeably in the last two weeks mainly for its high price and this could be the reason for the price fall, said Mohammad Faruq, director of wholesaler Era Traders.

The stocks were old and would not last long, he said, adding that new imports have started to arrive on a small scale.

Anwar Hossain, proprietor of Dhaka Traders, said they usually sold a truckload every day but sales had halved in the last two weeks. He thinks traders might have opted for lesser profits to avoid losses.

On prices still remaining high in kitchen markets, a staffer at Sarkar Traders at Karnaphuli CDA Market said they bought the stocks last week at a higher price and so they were charging accordingly.

He acknowledged that sales had decreased for this.

Sagir Ahmed of Bagdadi Corporation at Khatunganj hoped for further drops in wholesale prices within a few days which would eventually bring down retail prices.  

#### 2017-11-23 (NDTV): Government Imposes `$850` Per Tonne Minimum Export Price On Onion To Boost Local Supplies

New Delhi: The government on Thursday imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of `$850` per tonne on onion to increase domestic supplies and check rising prices. MEP is the minimum rate below which exports are not allowed. Onion MEP was scrapped in December 2015. In a notification, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said: "Export of onion...shall be permitted only on Letter of Credit (LC) subject to a MEP of USD 850 per tonne till December 31, 2017."

Export of all varieties of onions will be allowed only on LC, it added. Concerned over the rise in onion prices, Consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan in August had sought that MEP be imposed on its exports by the commerce ministry. He also sought the removal of sops on export of the kitchen staple.

Retail onion prices, which have shot up to Rs. 50-65 per kg in most cities, have come under pressure due to tight domestic supplies. The government has asked state-run MMTC to import 2,000 tonnes of onion, while other agencies Nafed and SFAC to buy onions locally and supply in consuming areas. Supplies got exhausted as large quantity of exports were undertaken in the first four months of the current fiscal. The country exported 1.2 million tonnes in April-July of this fiscal, up by 56 per cent from the year-ago period. Also, the new 2017-18 kharif crop -- which is being harvested -- is expected to be less owing to fall in acreage.

Recently, a senior consumer affairs ministry official had said that the new kharif crop is likely to be lower by 10 per cent as area sown is 30 per cent lower. About 40 per cent of the country's total onion crop is produced in the kharif season, and the rest during the rabi season. The kharif crop, however, cannot be stored. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat are the major onion producing states.


#### 2017-12-01 (Scroll.in): Onion price rise spreads to other Asian countries as key exporter India tries to restrict surge
Prices in Bangladesh, which imports the vegetable from India, reached an all-time high this week.
Onion price rise spreads to other Asian countries as key exporter India tries to restrict surge

Asian importers of Indian onions are struggling to secure supplies after New Delhi decided to make its exports costlier in order to rein in prices in its own market, Reuters reported on Friday.

Onions sold overseas by Indian traders must not be cheaper than `$850` (approximately Rs 54,826) per tonne till the end of the year, the government had said last week. This is making it difficult for traders in Bangladesh and Malaysia to buy the kitchen staple, which they used to buy from India for just around `$185` (Rs 11,932) a tonne in July.

“At the moment, there is nothing we can do but to wait,” Dhaka trader Mohammad Idris told Reuters. “We are hoping the price of onions will come down in India once their new harvest hits the markets.” Onion prices in Bangladesh have risen three times in just a few months, and were at an all-time high of 100 taka (Rs 78) per kg this week.

India is the world’s largest exporter of onions. However, record production last year led farmers to grow less onions this year to avoid losses, which has now pushed prices up. Earlier this week, retail prices in Delhi touched Rs 80 a kg.

When lack of supplies increases prices, the government imposes limits like the minimum export price, to discourage overseas traders from buying the commodity and allow more supplies to remain within the country.


#### 2017-12-01: Onion price slightly down, but still high
[Onion price slightly down, but still high ]

Onion prices have come down a little but are still way too high.

Yesterday, locally-grown onions were selling for Tk 90 a kg at the kitchen market in the capital's Karwan Bazar. However, the prices ranged between Tk 95 and Tk 100 in the grocery stores in the city.

Onions imported from India were being sold between Tk 75 and Tk 80 per kg.

A few days ago, the price of locally-produced onions shot up to Tk 100 and over after the neighbouring country imposed `$850` as Minimum Export Price for each tonne of onions.

India reset the MEP after nearly two years to increase supply in its domestic market and curb price hike there.

The country, which itself has a huge demand for the essential cooking ingredient, is a major source of onion for Bangladesh.

The retail prices in New Delhi have touched Rs 80 for a kg owing to tight supply, according to reports by some Indian media outlets.

That hike eventually had an impact on the Bangladeshi markets and the prices here spiralled, putting people in trouble.

“Onions have become too expensive,” Saiful Islam, who works at a private firm, had said after buying half a kg for Tk 50, a few days ago.

Onion prices which also rocketed outside the capital have started to drop.

For example, each kg of locally-grown and imported onions were selling for Tk 80 and Tk 65 in the kitchen markets in Dinajpur. They were higher the day before yesterday.

A week ago, the price of per kg of the imported ones was Tk 58.

Sirajul Islam, who runs a small restaurant in Dinajpur, said, "My family runs on the profit [of my business]. How can I do business if the price stays so high?"

Sheikh Ali Ahmed, a retired banker living in Khulna city, said he was struggling to meet his family expenses as the prices of other essentials, including rice, were too high.

Onion prices started soaring since flood hit the northern region of the country in August. That month, per kg of onions was sold at just Tk 25 per, said Asadul Islam, who lives in Dinajpur.

 Prices shot up further by the end of September and each kg of the imported onions was sold at Tk 65 in mid-October.

There was further price hike following crop loss in heavy rains in the neighbouring country.

Downpour also affected early varieties of locally grown onions at a time when old stocks were running out.

“Onion prices may remain at this level for another week,” Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital, said a few days ago.

Harun Ur Rashid, president of Importers and Exporters Group of Hili Land Port, said onion prices were soaring in the Indian domestic market. Besides, bad weather and flood in August also damaged onion fields, he said.

Harun said traders were losing interest in importing onions from India because of the `$850` MEP.

Importers could import onions at `$500` per tonne prior to India's move, according to traders.

The latest MEP for onion exports will remain effective until December 31, the Director General of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India said in a notification on November 23.

Narayan said prices of onions may drop in the coming months because of arrival of early varieties of locally grown bulbs.

“We are also getting onions imported from China and Egypt.”

Harun urged the Bangladesh government to facilitate faster import of bulb onions from other countries.


#### 2017-12-08 (NDTV): Why onion prices will remain volatile till the end of this month

Mumbai:  Onions saw a spike in prices over the last two weeks and much of it has to do with what happens in Maharashtra and Lassalgaon where most of the onion grown in Nashik is traded and sent to different parts of the country. Prices have now fallen but are yet to stabilize. The volatility in prices, traders say, will continue till the end of this month and prices will go down to early November levels once the fresh stock arrives in the market.

Onion prices had touched an yearly high last week going at almost Rs. 80 a kilogram. This week, prices have come down to Rs. 60 but likely to hover around 50 to 60 rupees till the end of December. 

The humble onion has seen a sharp spike in prices mostly due to the lack of supply. Traders at Mumbai's Dadar sabzi mandi or vegetable market say the trend is likely to continue till the end of this month because that's when the fresh stock will start arriving in the markets in full swing. 

Nashik in Maharashtra produces the largest quantity of onions in the country. Wholesale prices there touched an yearly high of Rs. 40 per kilogram last week. By the time it reached the main wholesale market in Navi Mumbai, the prices hit 50  to 55 rupees for a kilogram.

Ashok Varun, an onion Trader at a wholesale market in Navi Mumbai told NDTV, "Extra rainfall was witnessed after the monsoon months of June, July, August and September, a lot of onion crops were spoilt. Due to this, the crops which we usually start receiving during the time of Diwali were late."

By the time it reaches the wholesale market at Dadar in Mumbai, prices reach Rs. 60 to 70 for a kilogram and the consumer buys it from the retailer at Rs. 80 a kilogram. 

Hiraman Pardeshi, an onion trader in Nashik, told NDTV, "Four days ago, in the district of Nashik the rates of onion were between Rs. 2,000-4,000. Due to the increased rates of export duty the demand in the country has decreased and onion is not being exported."

With the ban on export and the decision to import 2,000 tonnes of onion, consumers, however, will get some relief from the spike in prices the government hopes. 

#### 2017-12-09: Overheated onion market likely to cool down in 2 weeks
onions,

UNB, Dhaka
The prices of onion, an essential kitchen vegetable, are expected to go down within the next two weeks with the arrival of new harvest, bringing a relief to consumers.

The onion prices have hit the roof with the consumers buying it at Tk 80 to 100 due to the recent flood and its curb on export by neighbouring India to keep stable its internal market.

According to official and private sources, onions produced during the Robi season will be enough to meet the country's demand throughout the year and the crisis will be over with the arrival of the new harvest.

The demand for onion in the country is around 22-24 lakh metric tonnes a year, while 18.66 lakh metric tonnes were produced last year, 1.31 lakh more than the previous year. Besides, 10.41 lakh metric tonnes were imported.

Onion prices started soaring after floods hit the country's northern region in August. Its price shot up further at the end of September and mid-October. "This is the time when onion prices remain high every year," said an official wishing not to be named.

The price hike of onion in neighbouring India, a major source of country's onion, due to crop loss in heavy rains also had an impact on price spiral of onion in Bangladesh.

Sultan, an onion farmer from Rajshahi's Ishwardi upazila, told UNB that the production this year was healthy, which will be enough to cover their losses over the last two years.

He said this year the cost of producing a kilogram of onion ranged between from Tk 20 to 22, which they could sell to local wholesalers at Tk 60 per kg, even up to Tk 65 if they could sell it to the wholesalers in Dhaka directly.

In the last two weeks, he said, they will be able to sell more of their stock, which will enable them to sell it in between Tk 45-55, allowing its retail price to decrease gradually.

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, onions are produced in almost all the districts of the country, but commercially more so in Pabna, Faridpur, Kushtia and Rajshahi.

Faruk, an employee at Janata Agency in Dhaka's Shyam Bazar, said local onions are selling at wholesale at between Tk 65 and Tk 75 per kg, while its Indian variety at between Tk 55 and 65.

In retail markets, however, the local onions are selling at Tk 90-95 per kg, while the Indian kind at Tk 80-85.

Retail traders are claiming that as the new stock of onions have still not hit the market, the prices remain high.

Golam Rahman, president of Consumers' Association of Bangladesh, said a group of unscrupulous traders may be behind the astronomical price of onions, as there is no logic for its price despite adequate supply.

But, he said, the price is affected due to similar conditions in India.

He said this scenario will continue until and unless the government keeps track of actual production figures and ensures strict monitoring of pricing at wholesale and retail level.

Golam Rahman was hopeful that the prices of onions will go down very soon.

#### 2017-12-10: Onion selling at Tk 120 a kg
Locally grown, they sold at Tk 85-95 a kg in city retail markets a week ago
[Onion selling at Tk 120 a kg ]
Staff Correspondent
Onion prices shot up to Tk 120 per kg in the kitchen markets of the city, an average rise of 28 percent from last week.

Yesterday, locally-grown onions were selling for Tk 110-Tk 120 per kg at retail in kitchen markets while the same quantity sold for Tk 85-95 a week ago.

Prices of imported onions also rose and were being sold for Tk 80- Tk 90 per kg yesterday, up from Tk 75- Tk 85 a week ago, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

“It appears that beggars will seek onions instead of taka the way prices are going up,” said an annoyed Md Shihab Uddin, who works at a private firm.

He said he was buying fewer onions expecting a fall in price owing to the arrival of a fresh harvest.

Traders said consumers will have to wait for two to three weeks to see increased supply of the essential cooking ingredient and buy the vegetable at lower prices.

However, some traders warned that arrival of early varieties of onions may be delayed owing to bad weather and yesterday's rainfall.

Prices of imported onions increased following imposition of `$850` as Minimum Export Price for each tonne of onions by the Indian authority.

India reset the MEP after nearly two years to increase supply in its domestic market and curb price hike there.

“The market has become dependent on Indian onions as stock of locally grown bulbs has almost exhausted. Besides, we had onions imported from other countries,” said Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital.

Some 90 percent stock of local onion has already been used up, he said.

“Increased imports will help cool down the prices,” said Mohammad Aminul Islam, another onion wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, a major kitchen market in Dhaka.

He said supply of locally grown onion declines fast in the major growing regions such as Pabna.

“Early harvested onions have started coming to the market. But the current rainfall will affect onion fields. A portion of the bulbs in the fields will be damaged if the rainfall continues for longer. The wet weather will affect harvest, supply and prices of onion,” he said.

“Cultivation is good. But it may take a month for enough availability of onion in the market,” he said.

Mohammad Mazed, secretary of Shyambazar Onion Samity, said a large amount of onions was damaged in the field due to the unseasonal rains in October. The recent rainfall is likely to affect crop too, he said.

He said prices of imported onions have dropped to Tk 63-64 per kilogram at wholesale at Shyambazar yesterday from Tk 67-68 couple of days ago.

“Supply has been short in India,” he said.

On import from other countries, he said some importers incurred losses due to a price fall after importing onions from countries such as Pakistan, China and Egypt prior and after Eid-ul-Azha in September.

That is why imports of onions from other countries have dipped, he said, adding that prices are likely to remain high for the next three weeks. But prices may not go up too much, he said.

In the last fiscal year, 15 lakh tonnes of onions were exported.

The Department of Agricultural Extension has targeted to bring 2.15 lakh hectares of land for onion cultivation during the 2017-18 fiscal year, up from 2.13 lakh hectares the previous year.

Onion production rose seven percent to 18.66 lakh tonnes in the 2016-17 fiscal year, up from 17.35 lakh tonnes the previous year, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).
