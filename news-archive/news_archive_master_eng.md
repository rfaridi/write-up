The total amount of default loan in Bangladesh now stands at Tk 1,11,347 crore, Finance Minister AMA Muhith told parliament today.
“The total default-loan at banks and commercial oragnisations stood Tk 1,11,347 crore till April 2017,” Muhith said citing the statistics of Credit Information Bureau of Bangladesh Bank.
Replying to lawmakers' queries, Muhith, in a scripted answer, also revealed the names of top 100 loan default organisations and companies.
He, however, did not mention how much money they have defaulted.
Top 20 of the 100 loan defaulters are: Mohammad Elias Brothers Pvt Limited, Jasmir Vegetable Oil Ltd, Max Spinning Mills Ltd, Benetex Industries Ltd, Dhaka Trading House, Anowara Spinning Mills, Yasir Enterprise, Quantum Power Systems Ltd, MM Vegetable Oil Products Ltd, Alppa Composite Towel Ltd, Western Marine Shipyard Limited, Mak International, Hall Mark Fashion Limited, Monno Fabrics Limited, Fair Trade Fabrics Limited, Saharish Composite Towel Limited, Nurjahan Super Oil Ltd, Saleh Carpet Mills Limited and SK Steel and Chowdhury Knitwear.
Earlier on June 20, the finance minister informed the House that the total number of loan defaulters is Tk 2.02 lakh.
A total of 2,02,623 persons or companies, which had borrowed money from 55 state and private-run commercial banks, defaulted on their loans till March 2017.
Muhith today informed the parliament that National Board of Revenue has seized around 4,490 kilogrammes of gold in last seven years from the airports and different other checkpoints.
In reply to another query, Muhith said there are 29,28,093 individual taxpayers in the country in the fiscal year 2016-17 and it was expected to reach 30 lakh at the end of the fiscal.
"Names of some nine lakh new taxpayers were registered in the first nine months of the 2016-2017 FY," he said.
He said that over four lakh new taxpayers submitted their returns in the same fiscal.
The government has taken various steps to bring more people under the tax net to expand it further; he informed the House adding that the government has undertaken steps to increase revenue collection to 50 percent from 37 percent by 2020-21 FY from income tax.

### 2017-07-12 Bleeding from bad loans  The Daily Star
Accumulated defaulted loans badly affect banking sector, whole economy
Sajjadur Rahman
Ballooning bad loans are crippling not only the banking sector but also the national economy as a whole as the authorities fail to recoup the loan money from big businesses, many of whom are willful defaulters, analysts say.
The ripple effects reach far and wide. To start with, banks cannot convert savings into loanable funds as they have to keep aside the amount equivalent to the bad loans as provision, which they cannot invest to maintain stability. As a result, banks' cost of funds shoots up and lending rates get higher.
All of this affects the banks' profit margin, scope of business expansion and the plan for job creation, according to experts.
Things are getting worse by the day as borrowers from some leading corporate groups to little-known businesses have been taking away depositors' money, never to return it.
Eight state-run banks are the worst victims as a fourth of their loans have gone bad.
As of April, the accumulated default loans in the economy is Tk 111,347 crore, which is higher than the development spending last fiscal year, as disclosed by Finance Minister AMA Muhith in parliament on Monday. The figure includes the written off loans totaling nearly Tk 40,000 crore.
Bangladesh Bank data show nonperforming loans account for 10.53 percent of the total outstanding loans. But analysts say the figure would have been much higher if loans had not been rescheduled and restructured.
In 2015, for example, the BB allowed large borrowers, with at least Tk 500 crore loans, to restructure their loans. Around Tk 15,000 crore were restructured that year alone.
Analysts say there is no record of anyone being punished for willful defaults. Such inaction is encouraging unscrupulous businesses and individuals to become defaulters willingly.
Experts think there is a lack of political will to deal with loan defaults, on which India has been cracking down for the last two years.
Prof Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said growing bad loans were impeding further economic growth as banks' lending capacity gets tightened and good clients could not get loans at lower rates.
Taking mortgage or collateral against loans at inflated price has become another big problem for banks that fail to sell mortgaged assets whose market prices are much lower than the loans, he added.
State-owned BASIC Bank is the victim of this practice as many little-known businesses took loans giving mortgages at inflated prices between 2009 and 2013 when Sheikh Abdul Hye Bacchu was chairman.
“We have been pursuing the government for the past three years to set up a commission for banks. But it did not pay any heed to the proposal,” said Prof Mustafizur.
If the commission was mandated to reform the sector, accountability, transparency and governance would have improved in the crippled banking industry, he added.
Zaid Bakht, an economist and current chairman of state-owned Agrani Bank, said use of loan money in unproductive sector, such as to buy land or to launder it, is detrimental to economic growth.
“Had the borrowers utilised the money in productive activities, they could have paid their loans back,” he said.
Willful defaulters take the advantage of legal loopholes, said a senior official of a state-owned Bank.
The official added they were pressing a borrower to pay back around Tk 500 crore. In response, the borrower went to the court that gave him 12 years' time with three years' moratorium.
Four state banks -- Sonali, Janata, Agrani and Rupali -- are feeling the pinch of these legal loopholes. The recovery of some Tk 27,700 crore loans remains uncertain because of court orders. Of the sum, over Tk 14,000 crore was taken from Sonali Bank. 
The managing director of a private bank voiced the same concern.
Helal Ahmed Chowdhury, former managing director of Pubali Bank, said a taskforce could be formed to heal the ailing banking sector.
“But political will is a must for that,” said Helal, also a supernumerary professor at the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management.
About the court orders, the veteran banker said banks had to overcome the problem with the help of the court.
Analysts also cited the example of India, which has been dealing with bad loans effectively in recent years.
Last year, India's central bank decided to clean up the balance sheets of Indian banks, which are collectively saddled with Rs 6 lakh crore bad loans, equivalent to 9 percent of the total outstanding loans in the economy.
After the Reserve Bank of India's order, banks have started cracking the whip on Indian companies for repayment of loans. Leading corporate houses, including Reliance, Tata, Birla and Essar, were forced to sell their prized assets to repay their bank loans.
Analysts also point out that enforcement of laws in India is much stronger than in Bangladesh.
For example, liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who is accused of defaulting Rs 9,000 crores in loans, was arrested from London in April.
Subrata Roy, chief of Sahara Group, which was the sponsor of India's national cricket team for years, is in jail for over two years now, for allegedly embezzling Rs 24,000, which he did not pay back to investors.

### 2017-07-17  No sign of relief from default loans - Dhaka tribune

No sign of relief from default loans
'Unless political will from both the opposition and the ruling parties, it is very difficult to come out of the bad culture of default loans'

Though it is a much-talked-about issue on default loans and everyone has thirst for relief from the nuisance, the country’s banking sector is unlikely to get rid of such ‘bad culture’ anytime soon.

Experts opine that time is up to eradicate this malignancy in the country’s economic driver as the national polls are nearing.

They said it is quite impossible to operate banking sector without default loans as there are ups and downs in loan recovery, but the concern is the wilful loan defaulters. Such debtors take the credit willing to be defaulters, and most of them have political link with incumbent governments.

Talking to the Dhaka Tribune yesterday, former Finance Adviser to the Caretaker Government AB Mirza Azizul Islam said: “One of the major reasons for the increase in loan defaulters is the sanction of credit on political consideration. For this, the banks failed to recover those loans.”

“There are habituated defaulters and they are in big numbers affiliated with political parties. The government has to identify them and take measures to realise loan from them,” Research Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Khondaker Golam Moazzem told the Dhaka Tribune.

“Unless political will from both the opposition and the ruling parties, it is very difficult to come out of the bad culture of default loans.”

    The time to bell the cats (loan defaulters) has gone. One has to understand political economy in this regard

As the incumbent government is in its outgoing period and the election is nearing, it is quite difficult for the government to take steps to stop loan disbursment and also recover from defaulters.

Thus the number of loan defaulters would not come down, rather increase in the upcoming months till the end of 2018, according to experts.

Economists stressed the need for political decision to come out of the loan default culture. There is a very little scope to stop loan default culture in near future as big businesses are involved in such anomalies, they added.

“If you look at our neighbouring country, India, the Modi government has taken steps to stabilise the financial sector soon after ascending to power. It was impossible before the election year,” an economist of one of the country’s leading independent think-tanks told the Dhaka Tribune.

“In the context of our country, the time to bell the cats (loan defaulters) has gone. One has to understand political economy in this regard,” he added.

Capture2

Besides political affiliation, experts also blamed the culture of impunity, weakness of existing laws and lack of technical expertise that help loan  defaulters to swindle money from the banks, especially from the state-owned banks.

“Default loan is on the rise since bankers did not maintain proper rules and regulations in disbursing and recovering loans,” said AB Mirza Azizul Islam.

He also said: “Taking the advantage of weakness of existing laws, some vested intersts took the loans and turned defaulters, but they yet to be punished, which also encourage others to be defaulter. Thus good borrowers become frustrated.”

“Artha Rin Adalat Ain (Financial Loan Court Act) needs to be upgraded so that none can take the opportunity of procrastination and ultimately escape it. Bangladesh government can declare defaulter as bankrupt but it must have transparent and proper law in this regard,” said Khondaker Golam Moazzem.

“Banks lack technical experts in analysing the eligibility of an organisation in getting loan amount sought by it. Even, it was noticed that the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) report was not properly done in checking eligibility of a client. On the other hand corruption in approving loans is another reason for default loans. The loanees escape some of the conditions in exchange of money,” said Moazzem.

He also said the default loans have a negative impact on new investment as the banks could not disburse loan on lower interest due to default loans.

“If there is an availability of funds in the banks, it would not leave much impact on investment, but the default loans create pressure on banks, which forced the banks to keep the interest rate at higher mark. Thus, the new investment projects are discouraged,” added Moazzem.

Finance Minister AMA Muhith told the Parliament on Monday about the overall defaulted loans in the banking sector and disclosed 100 top defaulters.

According to Muhith, financial institutions in Bangladesh currently have a default loan of Tk1,11,347 crore as of April this year.

He, however, did not give the amount of default loans against the individual defaulters.

He did not also disclose how many loan defaulters were in the country.

On June 20, he had informed the Parliament that 2,02,623 individuals or companies, who borrowed money from 55 state-run and private commercial banks, defaulted on their loans till March 2017.

According to Bangladesh Bank data, the defaulted loans in the banking sector increased to Tk73,409 crore as of March 30, 2017 from Tk62,172.32 crore as of December 31, 2016.

The amount of defaulted loans and the write-offs in the banking sector together stood at Tk1,18,099.64 crore at the end of the first quarter – January to March –  of 2017.

The SoBs are the most sufferers of default loans followed by Private Commercial Banks and Foreign ones.

Contacted, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Rupali Bank Md Ataur Rahman Prodhan told the Dhaka Tribune, “Though the figure in the latest data of default loans have seen a higher mark, the number of defaulters has decreased in recent times as we are more alert on disbursing loans.”

“The number of defaulters had increased as some defaulters, who were out of the default list, have been included into the list as per the central bank directives.”

Calling for upgradation of the existing laws in recovering the default loans, Md Ataur Rahman Prodhan said: “There is a need of modernising the laws related to realising the default loans.”

“It has been found that, once, we lodged a case against any defaulter and the defaulter files a writ against us. When the court rejects the defaulter’s appeal, he can files the writ again against the same case. Such kind of complexity is a hindrance towards recovering default loans.”

The Rupali Bank CEO also emphasised the need for creation of social awareness against loan defaulters and also called for social avoidance of the defaulters.

Prodhan termed the default loans an alarming for the country’s banking sector, urging all banksers to remain alert against default loans in the days to come.

Mentionable, banks are losing out on revenues continuously, thanks to the growing default culture, since banks have to keep provision against the bad loans from their incomes.

The situation is aweful in the state-owned banks that requre infiltration of capital from public money to remain functional.

The government injected a total of Tk13,705 crore as recapitalisation fund into the SoBs from FY2009-10 to 2016-17.

The finance minister also proposed to allocate Tk2,000 crore for recapitalisation during the Fiscal Year 2017-18.

### 2017-12-18 Where did the benefits of economic growth disappear? -bdnews24.com
Posted By M A Taslim On December 18, 2017 @ 12:10 AM In Comment | 2 Comments
https://opinion.bdnews24.com/2017/12/18/where-did-the-benefits-of-economic-growth-disappear/
There is some disquiet among economists about the quality of data provided by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). No less a person than the Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister has expressed his dissatisfaction about the qualifications of the BBS staff and the quality of their work. These are very long standing problems, and yet, very little has been done to improve the quality of the services provided by BBS.

The government is perhaps more worried about the embarrassment an efficient BBS can do to its image with correct data than the harm an inefficient BBS can inflict on policy making and, the economy with incorrect data.

The current feeling of consternation originates largely from the fact that macroeconomic data, such as economic growth rate, is frequently not consistent with other data, such as credit, export and import etc. with which they are supposed to be correlated.

Significantly, the latter is not provided by BBS, but by other government organisations such as Bangladesh Bank, National Board of Revenue and Export Promotion Bureau.

Inflating the data!

They provide high frequency data on a monthly basis with a short lag, which is more reliable. Reassuringly, most of the data can be crosschecked easily. For example, bank credit data provided by Bangladesh Bank can be cross checked against credit data of all individual banks. Any large unexplained discrepancy will be quickly discovered and corrected.

Forecasts of economic growth are made by local and foreign experts on the basis of available information on a host of variables, including international trends and current data on domestic production and expenditure as well as high frequency data as mentioned above.

Curiously, these forecasts have been always significantly lower than the final BBS estimates during the last several years. This pattern of non-random errors in the forecasts has led to the suspicion of inaccuracies, or worse, wilful manipulations of the national accounts data.

In the absence of a robust explanation as to why these experts could be mistaken, the suspicion has grown to almost a conviction. This is an unnecessary and avoidable situation that adversely affects the quality of analyses and evidence-based policymaking.

It has escaped notice that the national accounts estimates are also not consistent with some micro level data that provide a very good insight into the economic well-being of the ordinary people of the country.  The BBS does an extensive and thorough survey of income and expenditure of households about every five years. The final report of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey done in 2016 (HIES2016) was released recently. It provides micro level data on numerous household attributes such as size, education, health, income and expenditure etc.

Since the household sector comprises the entire population, these data are more relevant to the living standards of the ordinary people of the country than the national accounts data which provide aggregate measures on a few variables only.

HIES are a rich source of both time series and cross section data that can be used to seek answers to a variety of research questions.

Household income: behind the rosy facade

Household income and consumption as estimated by HIES2016 are given below in Table 1. The nominal income and consumption both increased by about two-fifths since the last HIES was done in 2010. These were highlighted when the survey results were released. However, there is no definable relationship between household nominal income and its purchasing power. The latter is captured by real income. Similarly, the actual volume of consumption is expressed by real consumption. Real income and consumption are derived by deflating the nominal amount by the consumer price index (CPI).

Economic growth of a country is represented by the growth of real income or output. The estimated real values of household income and consumption are shown in column 5 and 6. It is immediately apparent that the real magnitudes suggest a very different pattern of change than that by the nominal amounts; the household real income has actually declined by 11 percent between 2010 and 2016. Real consumption also declined by about the same proportion during these years.

But according to BBS national accounts statistics, the real national income of the country has risen by more than 42 percent between 2009-10 and 2015-16 while the real per capita income has risen by 31 percent.  In other words, at the national level, each individual member of the total population, on average, has contributed to 31 percent increase in real income during these 6 years. This increase in income was accompanied by a similar increase in real consumption per capita.

In stark contrast, according to HIES2016, each person at the household level actually received an income (household income divided by household size) that was 2 percent less than what they had received in 2010 and the real spending for consumption of each decreased by about 1 percent.

The changes in per capita income and consumption that can be gleaned from the national accounts data are thus opposite to the information provided by HIES2016. The differences between the HIES and the national accounts data are rather too large to be ignored as statistical errors or due to different methods of calculation.

Note that there was no large discrepancy for the period 2005 to 2010. The HIES2016 data clearly indicates that the household sector comprising the entire population has missed out entirely on the growth dividend of the period 2010 to 2016 that should have normally been accrued to them. The share of government revenue in national income also did not increase during this period.

Where did the benefits of economic growth disappear? The Planning Ministry (which oversees BBS) owes an explanation to the nation about the sources of this anomalous finding.

The calorie quotient

The reduction in per capita real income is given some support by the nutrition data of HIES2016. Globally, there is a strong correlation between income and calorie consumption. People in the richer countries consume more calories than those in the poorer countries. The data of earlier HIES also suggest that richer people of the country consume more calories than the poorer people.  An alarming finding of HIES2016 is that the average calorie intake per person has declined by 5 percent from 2318 Kcal in 2010 to 2210 Kcal in 2016 alongside a reduction in real income.  A joint FAO and WHO study mentioned that the average calorie intake should be 2430 Kcal (Country Nutrition Paper 2014). The daily intake of calorie in 2010 was already 5 percent below the recommended amount, but a further reduction to 9 percent in 2016 raises the real prospect of stunting and wasting of children as well as a generally poor health of the population. This does not augur well for the country: its population does not appear to be in a fit state to fully utilise the opportunity for demographic dividend.

Falling income is also hinted by another comprehensive study of BBS, Revision and Rebasing of Wage Index (WRI) from 1969-70 to 2010-11. Its findings indicate that the real wage of the ordinary workers in the informal sector, who constitute about 85 percent of the labour force, fell by more than 7.5 percent between 2010-11 and 2014-15. Such a reduction must have exerted a strong downward pressure on household income since wages are a large part of household income.

Gini Coefficient

Another alarming finding reported by HIES2016 is a substantial increase in the Gini coefficient. The income distribution has moved against the poor including the wage labourers very markedly. The poorest one-fifth of the household population received 2.78 percent of the total income in 2010, but by 2016 their share has declined to a measly 1.24 percent.

On the other hand, the top 5 percent households have increased their share from 24.6 percent to 27.9 percent during the same period. Enriching the richest at the expense of the hapless poorest has apparently gained momentum during the last 6 years. This has reversed the trend of the previous 5 year period.

The Gini coefficient had declined from 0.467 in 2005 to 0.458 in 2010 heralding the prospect of a progress toward a more egalitarian society. But the hope has been nipped in the bud with the Gini coefficient shooting up considerably to attain its highest ever level of 0.483 in 2016. This puts Bangladesh in the company of the least egalitarian countries of the world.

It is surprising that with real per capita income at the household level not rising at all between 2010 and 2016 and the Gini coefficient worsening, the head count poverty rate declined so markedly from 31.5 to 24.3 percent during these years.

The national accounts data of BBS paint a glowing picture of Bangladesh as a stable high performing dynamic economy. But the HIES2016 findings suggest a stagnant lacklustre economy where the household sector (comprising the entire population) have completely missed out on the benefits of the high economic growth with both their average income and consumption falling. These contradictory findings from the data of two of the most widely used BBS sources are likely to deepen the suspicion regarding BBS data quality and further erode its credibility unless some satisfactory explanations are offered.

The benefits have disappeared to foreign shores where our chest beating patriotic leaders of all hues and especially the Awami league with their domination of politics over the last few years, have made their nests which they continue to feather as long as they can at the expense of the poor people of this country.

### 2017-10-31 Runaway cost of living - Daily Star
    According to the Consumers Association of Bangladesh, the cost of living for Dhaka residents has risen 71 percent over the period 2009–2016. Photo: Prabir Das
    Syed Mansur Hashim
    People, particularly those who belong to the lower income groups, have been reeling under the weight of rising cost of living for some years now. A report in a leading Bangla daily on October 27 spelled out the situation in a nutshell. According to the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), the cost of living for Dhaka residents has risen 71 percent over the period 2009–2016. This survey is based on a calculation of cost increases of 114 foodstuffs and 14 utility services (and does not include cost rise of education, health and daily travel).
    A decade ago, a couple where both members worked could pay house rent, send their children to school and maintain a reasonable standard of living and still have savings. Those days appear to be gone for good. The runaway inflation when it comes to the manner in which our kitchen market prices operate, the rate at which house rent appears to increase every year and the yearly hikes in utility service prices have all but put people in some income brackets in a situation where it is becoming increasingly untenable to live with families in Dhaka city.
    CAB reinforces this with data. According to the association, the rent value of a two-room concrete house/apartment used to be Tk 10,800 in 2009 which had risen to an average of Tk 19,700 in the year 2016 (a rise of 82.4 percent in less than a decade). The cost of per unit of electricity has risen nearly 93 percent, water bill has gone up by 56 percent and increase in public transport per kilometre has gone up by 45 percent. When we look at food inflation, prices have actually risen several times each year over this period. Again, if we refer to CAB information, the price of coarse rice went up by Tk 12/kg (from Tk 23 to Tk 35) over this period and was trading at Tk 46/kg in the month of September. Mapping out all products in various categories is unnecessary to get an idea of how prices have increased exponentially over a seven-year period. Incomes unfortunately have not kept up with such increases and hence the problem.
    The biggest casualty of all this of course is that people are unable to set aside a portion of their earnings as savings. Things are in fact at a stage that some income groups are in debt a major portion of the year and hence there is no question of savings. When we couple food inflation (the highest rise) along with other indicators, Dhaka residents are in a major fix, but the lower middle class and working class are hardest hit. When the price of utility services rises (power, water), this affects producers too. However, whatever extra costs incurred at production level are usually passed on to end users, i.e. retail consumers. But there are discrepancies here, particularly in the urban public transport sector. A fractional rise in cost of fuel is not corresponded by an equal rise in fare; it is usually much more. The same can actually be said about the pricing of products and services that an average resident uses. House rent for instance follows no set pattern and tenants are completely at the mercy of landlords. One cannot fully explain how wholesale and retail kitchen markets work in our country. Every time we suffer a natural calamity, we find ourselves at the short end of the stick—and as pointed out above, finding out the price of coarse rice (the biggest selling segment in the rice market) going up Tk 12 per kilo in the span of a month! The education sector, the bulk of which is dominated by the private sector, follows no set pattern when it comes to setting tuition fees. Beyond the regular monthly tuition fees of course is a slew of other “charges” that can range from “development fees” to whatever the institution deems fit.

    It appears that we have built for ourselves a laissez-faire system which is defined in economics as: “abstention by governments from interfering in the workings of the free market.” That certainly looks to be the case for the majority of Dhaka's populace. We have regulatory bodies and certain rules to look after consumers' interests. However, these regulations are confined to print and there are hardly visible steps to implement them. People will continue to adapt to harder times—by consuming less, enjoying fewer city amenities, getting into more debt, etc. Until our policymakers actually start practising what they preach i.e. implementing laws enacted or rules formulated to protect consumers' interests, people will be left to fend for themselves—as they always have—and the quality of life will continue to decline in Dhaka city.

Middle class feels the squeeze at rising cost of living
A number of Bangladeshi economists pointed out that higher food prices and lower income eventually leads to malnutrition, starvation and physical complications, which in turn are severely affecting the working class families Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune
In 2016, the national household income was at Tk15,945, a 45% increase from Tk7,203 in 2005. On the other hand, the national household expenditure was at Tk15,715 in 2016, a 39% rise from Tk6,134 in 2005.

Shahed Mehbub, 35, currently employed as a mid-ranking executive in a private IT firm, is looking to rent a small 800 square feet apartment. He plans to move from his existing 1,100 sq ft two-bed apartment in Mohammadpur before January next year, as the landlord is getting ready to increase the rent yet again.

Mehbub, who has been living in that apartment for the last eight years, initially paid a rent of Tk8,000 per month. However, the rent has nearly doubled since then, currently standing at Tk15,000. Back then, his monthly income was Tk16,000; now it stands at Tk39,000.

Though his income has more than doubled in the years, so has the expenses. A closer look at his expenditure shows that what he earns is barely sustainable.

Apart from the Tk15,000 for rent, he spends Tk12,000 on food. Another Tk2,000 goes for his children’s education and Tk6,000 for his mother and sister in the countryside. Utilities and other expenses take up roughly Tk4,000.

This leaves little room for emergencies and no room for savings. The cost of food commodities is a great burden, and any increase in rent only adds to the surmounting pressure.

“The landlord is planning to raise the rent again by 15%. If only the commodity prices had remained stable, I could have afforded to stay here,” said Mehbub, head of a three-member family.

He said aside from paying more and more for essential commodities, he is now sending his daughter to school.

“It is difficult for me to afford any additional costs. To continue living in Dhaka, I must move into a smaller apartment,” he added.

The situation this lower-middle income office worker is facing is nothing unusual in Dhaka. The house rent hike, along with massive increases in commodity prices, utilities and other essentials have adversely affected the lives of most city dwellers.

According to the Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB), the cost of living for Dhaka residents kept going up in the last 10 years, from 2006 to 2016.

Several estimates reveal that tenants are spending around 35% to 50% or more of their income to pay house rent.

In 2006, rent for a two bedroom floor in a concrete house was only Tk3,740, which stood at an average rate of Tk19,700 last year.

The slum dwellers are even more vulnerable to the rent hike, as their rent was hiked from Tk2,250 to Tk8,500 during the same period.

Aside from the house rent, charges for essential utility services like gas, electricity and water has also gone up by around 50%.

The cost of a two burner stove went up to Tk650 from Tk400 in 2006 (62.5% hike), per unit of electricity is now at Tk6.99 from Tk4 in 2006 (74.75% hike) and per unit water is now costs Tk10 from Tk5.50 of 2006 (81.8% rise), CAB data shows.

In a latest development, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) on Thursday raised the price of retail electricity Tk0.35 per unit, or 5.3% on a weighted average, putting more pressure to consumers.

As the average household income saw an increase in the last decade, the household expenditure also witnessed a sharp rise.

In 2016, the national household income was at Tk15,945, a 121% increase from Tk7,203 in 2005. On the other hand, the national household expenditure was at Tk15,715 in 2016, a 156% rise from Tk6,134 in 2005.

Although the cost of living and household income has increased in the last decade, but this statistic does not apply to all income groups.

Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, a significant number of people from low and middle income groups said they are spending a major portion of their income for food, which left no room for savings in their budget.

Rubel Miah, a rickshaw puller from Rangpur earns about Tk500 a day, but it is quite hard for him to make ends meet as the prices of essential goods are sky-rocketing.

“Of course, I do earn more money than what I used to make 10 years ago, but I cannot put aside money for savings after buying essential commodities for my family,” Rubel said.

A 2015 survey report by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) reveals that a rickshaw puller earns around Tk446 a day, and work on an average 26 day a month. After paying rent to the rickshaw owner, their net income stands at around Tk368 per day.

The average earnings of rickshaw and van pullers are Tk500 a day and Tk12,620 a month, the survey report said.

Addressing the issue, Dhaka University’s development studies department professor Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir said: “If the actual labour wages and general inflation had risen simultaneously, it would not have been a matter a concern. However, the BBS survey found that the labour price has dropped by 8% from 2010-11 to 2014-15.”

The data clearly shows that the poor had been hit the hardest by inflation, said Titumir, who is also the chairman of multidisciplinary think tank Unnayan Onneshan.

A number of economists pointed out that the change in inflation rate has affected the intricate relationship among commodity prices, low labour wages, and changes in food habit.

Higher food prices and lower income eventually leads to malnutrition, starvation and physical complications, which in turn are severely affecting the working class families.

Prof Rashed also added that the production cost has risen exponentially, as the government did not act on time, nor did it take timely steps such as reducing the tariff and launching OMS sales to tackle the food shortage.

“This directly contributed to the exorbitant price hike of essential commodities.”

Ahmed Ullah Bhuiyan, a retired government service holder who lives in Dhaka’s Mohakhali area, said it is becoming increasingly difficult to support a five-member family because of the sky-rocketing prices.

One of his sons is employed at a private firm and helps him out by paying the house rent and bills. But, the increasing cost of living has forced the family to cut their expenses.

“We had to drastically change our food habit. We rarely eat meat or fish anymore, and our family goes full vegetarian in the last ten days of the month. However, prices of eggs and vegetables are also very high,” he added.

Ahmed even had to take out money from two of his DPS prematurely in the last year to manage the educational expenses for his other two children.

Preliminary report on Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016, conducted by the BBS revealed that the share of food expenditure was 53.81% in 2005, but it had dropped to 47.69% in 2016, indicating that people now spend more on their non-food expenses at a national level.

The data indicates that though quality of life has improved for most, people are now spending more on non-food expenditures such as house rent, fuel and electricity, healthcare, education.

According to a CAB report, Najirshail rice was being sold at Tk26 per kg in 2006 and was at Tk56 in 2016, an increase of 115% during the period.

The price of miniket rice also saw a 71% rise as it was increased from Tk28 in 2006 to Tk48 in 2016.

Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) data says the price of Najirshail rice was sold at Tk56 to Tk60 while Miniket (fine quality) was sold at Tk60 to Tk65 in November, 2017.

The price hike has also reportedly affected the protein intake among people, as the price of eggs went up from Tk51 to Tk102 per dozen, beef from Tk139 to Tk426 per kg and chicken from Tk81 to Tk151 per kg during that period.

Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow at Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said the GDP growth has increased to 6.5%, along with the household income and standard of living in the last ten years, but spending among low and fixed income people have also gone up significantly.

“The ever increasing expenditure is impacting the lives of the people. Rice prices have gone up by 10% in the last ten years. The quality of our life has not improved on par with the rising cost of living,” he added.

Mustafizur pointed out that in 2016, GDP growth was 7% and the inflation rate was 8%, which means that the standard of living of people has decreased.

“The people have also been affected by income inequality. There will be no solution to this crisis unless this inequality is properly addressed,” Mustafizur told the Dhaka Tribune.

The economist advised the government to create more sustainable and productive employment opportunities to tackle this problem.

“The government needs ideal fiscal, monitoring and security policies. It is also important to ensure good governance and tax security,” opined the CPD distinguished fellow.

Discussing the issue, CAB president Ghulam Rahman suggested that the government should diligently implement the house rent laws, reduce the use of imported fuel, and establish low cost power plants to help curb the rising cost of living.

“The lack of timely decisions by the government may fuel further inflation in Bangladesh, as imports will be more expensive. This will have an adverse impact on overall economy, but the fixed income groups are likely to bear the brunt of the financial crisis,” Prof Rashed said.

### 2017-12-23 Death bells toll for the Bitcoin! - bdnews24.com
Posted By Mehdi Chowdhury On December 23, 2017 @ 4:17 AM In Comment | No Comments
Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies experienced massive appreciation in prices in recent times. In the last one month, the price of Bitcoin has almost doubled. The same is true for other crypto-currencies. Many are comparing this phenomenon to the Tulip Mania of the 16th Century.

However, Tulip Mania happened in a far distant past and this comparison does not seem to have any effect on the enthusiasm of investors.

In order to understand Bitcoin Bubble and how it will burst, we need to ask one of the fundamental questions of Economics, i.e. the value creation of a commodity.

To understand the value creation of Bitcoin, we need to understand its origin from Blockchain technology.

Understanding Blockchain Technology

The Blockchain technology used in Bitcoin first appeared in a white paper by someone using the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto.

The true identity of the author is still unknown. Using the technology, massive calculations need to be done by a large number of people to verify transactions. The process is known as mining and the individuals who conduct the mining are known as the miners.

Bitcoins are rewards of successful completion of the calculations. Therefore, the minimum price of a Bitcoin is the cost of conducting the calculation for obtaining a Bitcoin.

Initially, the cost of these calculations were very low; now it is very high.

The mining today needs to be done using something like supercomputers while the electricity consumption of these calculations are tremendous. The high price of a Bitcoin reflects the cost of the current mining of a Bitcoin.

The value of a commodity also reflects our willingness to pay for that particular item. For example, there is a cost of gold mining, however, the price of gold also reflects our willingness to pay for gold.

Value is determined by our perception

Similarly, the price of a Bitcoin should reflect our willingness to pay for a Bitcoin. The obvious question is, what is the use of a Bitcoin? For example, gold is used for transactions. In addition, gold is used in jewellery because of our perception of it as a unique and a beautiful metal.

The Blockchain technology states that the Bitcoins can be used for transactions and the transactions made using the Blockchains are cheaper than the usual mechanism of transfer through banks or third parties.

This cost effectiveness gives Blockchain the edge over banks or third party based transactions.

However, Bitcoin has no other unique characteristics. Gold is a unique metal and that uniqueness is valued by us. There is no close substitute for gold. The use of Bitcoin is easily substituted by another crypto-currency.

For example, a company wants to use a crypto-currency for remitting money from the UK to Japan. In order to obtain it, the company decides to opt for mining.

Question is, which crypto-currency will the company mine?

Bitcoin has become expensive to mine

Bitcoin now involves a very costly procedure. To be honest, this currently has no cost advantage over other crypto-currencies in facilitating transactions.

We should also note that the acceptability of currency is an important factor here. At the moment, there are many crypto-currencies in the market. Most are not directly convertible to regular currency like Dollar, Pound, EURO and the Yen.

These crypto-currencies first need to be exchanged to Bitcoins, and then to regular currency.

Though Bitcoin presently has monopoly, this will possibly change in the near future

One may argue that there is no need to mine new Bitcoin; instead, a company can just buy Bitcoins from the market and use that to remit money.

For example, someone wants to send 500 pounds to Japan. There is no need to buy a whole Bitcoin as crypto-currencies are infinitely divisible.

The company can exchange £500 to buy Bitcoin equal to 0.0417 (approx.) or another crypto-currency Litecoin equal to 1.557(approx.).

Both Bitcoin and Litecoin have the same purchasing power, however Litecoin needs to be exchanged to Bitcoin in most of the exchanges.

Therefore, there is an additional cost of using the Litecoin. This should give Bitcoin a cost advantage.

I feel this advantage will not last long.

Cypto-currencies are gaining widespread acceptance, along with their direct exchangeability.

A maximum number of 21 million Bitcoins can be mined due to the initial protocol set up by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The fallacy of value

It is hence argued that Bitcoin is a precious asset. This is a just an illusion. Crypto-currencies are infinitely divisible.  A single gold dust has no use and .05 gold makes no sense. On the contrary, this is not a problem in the cryptocurrency world.

These 21 million can be in the hand of 1 million, 21 million or, 1 billion.

On the other hand, the limit of mining is a disadvantage. This implies a limit of the coverage of information containment of a Blockchain in both spatial and time dimensions. That will eventually make Bitcoin and other early Crypto-currencies obsolete in the future.

The biggest challenge comes from the free entry into the market. The crypto-currencies can be substituted in actual transactions.

Meanwhile, new entrants will come with improved technologies to deliver cost advantages, thereby having market dominance.

Phenomenal profit signals fast falls!

As long as there is abnormal profit, this free entry will continue.  Any unusual profit from a crypto-currency therefore is a short term phenomena.

Bitcoin enjoyed this appealing image for a long period though this may not be the case for other such currency.

Predictions state that by 2040, the limit of 21 Million for Bitcoin mining will be reached. As the mining cost is already very high, the future miners may not mine Bitcoin anymore and the limit may never be reached.

Hence, The Bitcoin mining is likely to experience a shutdown before 2040.

Will Bitcoin still be transacted in the future? This also seems unlikely. The entrants will come with new effective solutions to transaction problems.

Current Blockchain platforms will be driven out of market. There is a possibility that the new technologies will incorporate the existing Blockchain, obviously, subject to the technological feasibility of that incorporation.

However, this incorporation does not ensure existence of a strong future market for the current Blockchains.

The current Blockchains will be like ancient underground cities smothered and obscured by modern megacities.

Therefore, my prediction is that the Bitcoin and other crypto-currency bubbles will bust hard and be out of the market.

There can be only short term trading gains, lasting for the next 1, 2 or 5 years.

The advice: nobody should treat crypto-currencies as long term investment.

### Jan 18, 2018: Crop protection industry: a contributor in disguise
[Crop protection industry: a contributor in disguise]
Sazzadul Hassan

Nur Hossain, a veteran farmer from Purbo Begunbari of Thakurgaon district, cultivated 12 acres of land last boro season with two of the country's most popular rice varieties: BR-28 and 29.

Everything was progressing as expected, but few days before the harvest Hossain noticed that the panicles were becoming straw-coloured, and in time, they started dropping to the ground.

His whole field got affected badly, leaving him with only 50 percent of the yields, which he normally used to get.

This heartbreaking account was the story of many farmers across the country last boro season. Consequently, the country's overall rice production was badly impacted, which led to the rice price spiral.

This disaster occurred due to a deadly disease called Blast, caused by an obnoxious fungus named Magnaporthe Oryzae.

There are 30,000 species of harmful weeds, 3,000 species of deadly nematodes, 10,000 species of plant-eating insects and numerous dangerous fungus against which the crops have to fight for their survival. These harmful weeds, insects and fungi are commonly referred as pests.

A study revealed that globally an average of 35 percent of the potential crop yield is lost to pests and diseases. Another study showed the loss of food production due to diseases, insects and weeds.

Crop protection (CP) products commonly known as pesticides or agrochemicals are used to control the harmful pests.

There are different categories of pesticides like insecticides for controlling insects, herbicides for managing weeds, fungicides for protecting the plants from various diseases.

Sanitisers, plant growth regulators (PGR), rodenticides and so on are also considered as pesticides.

Besides controlling the deadly pests, some CP products have crop enhancement (CE) properties that enhance crops' vigour and improve flower and fruits settings ability, resulting in more yields.

These chemistries also help the grains or fruits to become shinier and bolder and eventually facilitate the farmers to obtain better market price for their produces.

Consumption of pesticides globally is about two million tonnes per year, according to a report.

Of the amount, Europe alone consumes 45 percent, the US 25 percent and the rest of the world the remaining 30 percent.

Herbicides account for 48 percent of total pesticides applied globally, followed by insecticides at 30 percent and fungicides at 18 percent.

China is the largest pesticide-consuming country in the world, followed by the US and Argentina. 

Statistics show that China also leads the table in per hectare pesticide usage with around 14.82 kg, followed by Japan at 11.85 kg. 

Pesticide consumption in per hectare of land in some of the other developed countries is: France 3.9 kg, Germany 3.8 kg, the UK 2.93 kg, Canada 1.45 kg, and the US 2.42 kg.

In Bangladesh, it is about 1.86 kg. Total pesticide consumption in 2016 was about 35,000 tonnes, of which 14,000 tonnes were the active ingredients, according to data from the Bangladesh Crop Protection Association (BCPA).

The CP industry is playing a critical role in the country's agriculture sector in terms of enhancing food production and thus contributing to the overall economy. The present market value of the industry is about `$250` million.

In the last ten years, the industry has experienced nearly 10 percent cumulative annual growth. It is expected to grow at a similar pace, if not better, since the country needs to boost its agriculture productivity to ensure food security for its increasing population.

At present, there are about 350 companies working in the sector, employing roughly 25,000. Approximately 50,000 dealers across the country are involved in selling pesticides.

Despite its significant contribution to the country's agriculture, the industry often fails to get due recognition; rather, wrong perceptions exist about pesticides in the minds of many.

Sometimes, preservatives like formalin or chemicals like carbide are mixed up with agrochemicals.

But, the industry is highly regulated and governed by law of the land: the Pesticides (Amendment) Act, 2009 which originated from Pesticide Ordinance, 1971, regulates the import, manufacture, formulation, sale, distribution and the use of pesticides.

Recently, the cabinet endorsed the Balai Nashak (Pesticide) Act 2017.

To deal with the wrong perceptions, the BCPA along with the leading companies should engage with different stakeholders to inform them of the facts.

They need to keep on promoting integrated pest management (IPM), which is a well-recognised scientific means recommended by scientists and competent authorities to handle pest problems.

IPM does endorse the usage of chemicals or pesticides along with other ways and means. Growers should be adequately trained on the safety measures to be taken during pesticide application to avoid any adverse impact.

Another acute challenge for the sector is the counterfeit and adulterated products. Farmers often get cheated with fake chemicals.

The concerned regulatory authorities along with the law enforcing agencies need to strengthen their vigilance and bring those unscrupulous peddlers to justice to safeguard farmers' interests.

This is a highly technical sector that requires sound knowledge. To ensure judicious use of pesticide, there is no alternate to imparting the knowledge across the value chain, from the dealers to the farmers.

The concerned stakeholders should join hands for extensive training and education, which would benefit the country's agriculture significantly as well as clear the wrong perceptions about pesticides.

### Rice

#### 2017-04-11: Rice prices rise on flash floods (Daily Star)
Sohel Parvez

Rice prices edged up as large millers are cashing in on crop losses, caused by the recent flash floods in the greater Sylhet region, amid depleting stocks from previous harvests and low imports, said traders.

In Dhaka, retail prices of coarse rice such as the swarna variety rose to a new level of Tk 40-42 a kilogram now, up 6.49 percent from Tk 37-40 a week ago.

Prices of the medium and fine categories of the staple also went up between 1.96 percent and 4.65 percent in the last one week, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

The prices rose in other parts of the country as well.

Millers and traders said rice prices typically go up near the end of a season for dwindling stocks.

“There is a shortage of paddy in the market. The small mills do not have paddy, and neither do the large mills. Those who had paddy might have milled the grain to empty their storages and make space for freshly harvested grains,” said Chitta Majumder, managing director of Majumder Group of Industries that operates an auto rice mill.

Every year, paddy markets usually get an initial supply from harvests from the haor or seasonal water bodies in the northeastern region. Farmers in the region usually begin to harvest their crops in the third week of April.

However, floods in the haor regions have not only affected standing crops and caused losses to growers but also dampened prospects of an early arrival of fresh paddy, said Nirod Boron Saha, a wholesaler in Naogaon, one of the main rice trading hubs in the northwest.

“We usually rely on supplies from the haor region until harvests in the north begins; it keeps prices stable in the initial days of the harvest season.”

The haor areas account for nearly 10 percent of the total boro cultivation area at about 48 lakh hectares this year.

The flood has affected 1.40 lakh hectares of paddy in the fields, according to estimates of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).

Saha said speculation over delayed harvest for the bad weather is another reason for the recent price spiral as farmers, small and medium millers and wholesalers do not have paddy stocks.

“Only large mills have grains now,” he said.

Bappi Saha, a rice miller from the northeastern district of Netrokona, said, “This may be an artificial shortage.” The price hike is temporary, he added.

“The government, for the time being, can reduce the import duty on rice to encourage imports and increase the supply in the market,” he said.

Rice imports by private traders slumped 65 percent to 76,600 tonnes in July-March of the current fiscal year from the same time last year, after the government hiked the duty from 20 percent to 28 percent to ensure that growers get fair prices for their produce.

Boro, one of the three rice crop seasons in a year, accounts for nearly 55 percent of the country's annual rice output of 3.47 crore tonnes.

DAE earlier targeted to ensure the production of 1.91 crore tonnes of rice during the current boro season to attain the total output goal of 3.51 crore tonnes for this fiscal year.

Rice production in the two crop seasons -- aus and aman -- rose 0.11 percent to nearly 1.58 crore tonnes year-on-year, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Aus output declined but aman production rose, according to the BBS.

#### 2017-04-30: Fresh spike in rice prices (Daily Star)

Prices of all varieties of rice crept up owing to crop losses for flash floods, rainfall, disease attacks on standing paddy and depleting stocks.

The price of the coarse variety of rice went up 13 percent to Tk 42-45 a kilogram at retail levels in Dhaka yesterday, from Tk 37-40 a month ago.

Year-on-year, the price of coarse rice, which is an indicator of the rice market, rose 32 percent yesterday, according to data from Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

The price of the medium and fine grains also edged up -- by Tk 2-4 a kilogram -- over the weekend, according to TCB and the Department of Agricultural Marketing.

“There is a shortage of rice at the mills while the stock of paddy is nil as well. The flood-induced damage of paddy in the haor region and recent rainfalls came as a blow for the market,” said KM Layek Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Auto, Major and Husking Mills Association.

The price spike of the staple comes at a time when stocks at the public warehouses hit a six-year low and imports slumped due to a duty hike. At this time of year, stocks from the previous harvest typically begin to dwindle and fresh paddy harvests come in from the haor regions in the northeast, said traders and millers.

But floods in the back swamps have wiped out crops, causing a loss of 4.5 lakh tonnes of cereal, according to the government's primary estimates.

“There is no hope. It would be tough to recover the losses,” Ali said.

With farmers struggling to recover a part of their crops in the hoar areas, rainfall and floods affected standing boro in some districts in the northwest as well.

The attack of fungal diseases in some fields has worsened the situation, dampening prospects for boro paddy that accounts for about 55 percent of the total annual supply of the staple at 3.47 crore tonnes.

The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) earlier projected the production of 1.91 crore tonnes of rice in the current boro season, as part of its goal of bagging 3.51 crore tonnes in fiscal 2016-17. Millers said farmers in the northwest usually begin harvests at the end of April. But it is yet to start in full swing.

“There is an acute shortage of paddy in the local haats in the growing areas. Wherever there is a supply of fresh harvests, buyers are rushing to the spot. There also are reports of advance selling by some millers,” he said.

Abdur Rashid Dawan, proprietor of Matin Rice Agency, a commission agent at the rice wholesale depot of Babubazar in Dhaka, said millers could not supply the required quantity of rice because of inadequate supplies.

He placed orders for 30 tonnes of rice with a miller last week; the miller supplied half the order. “I will contact the mill again tomorrow (today).”

The supply of paddy remains low as many farmers could not harvest the already matured paddy because of bad weather, he said.

“Rainfall has also delayed ripening of the grain. But it appears that supply will rise in a week, if the current weather continues.”

Towfiqul Islam Khan, research fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said a diminished stock of rice and loss of boro crops are promoting speculation in the rice market.

The rising price of coarse rise is particularly affecting the extreme poor working in the non-farm informal sector, including the urban slum dwellers.

This group spends about 40 percent of their total income on rice, he added. “It is critical to enhance efforts towards country-wide open market sales and relief works in the flood affected haor areas.”

Khan said the rising prices may also affect boro season procurement, as the offered price may not appear lucrative.  The government must keep a close eye on it and explore import options, he added.

The government aims to buy seven lakh tonnes of paddy and eight lakh tonnes of rice during the harvest of boro at Tk 24 and Tk 34, which is 4 percent and 6 percent higher than last year's.

#### 2017-06-07: Coarse rice price soars (Daily Star)
42pc rise in a year; govt to import 3 lakh tonnes of rice on urgent basis
[Coarse rice price soars]

Among the essential commodities, coarse rice price registered the highest rise in the last one year, according to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) which keeps track of prices of daily necessities.

Prices of coarse rice, mostly consumed by the poor and people of lower-middle income groups, went up 42 percent since June last year.

Even though the private sector imported one lakh tonne of rice during that time, paying 25 percent import duty, the price of a kg of coarse rice was Tk 45-46 this week. In the first week of June 2016, it was Tk 30-34 a kg.

Though prices of finer and medium quality rice varieties registered 9 to 20 percent rise during the same period, price hike of coarse rice was worrying the government.

To add to its worries, public granaries now only have 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice, a six-year low yearend stock.

Over 10 lakh tonnes of boro crop were lost this year to early flooding in seven haor districts and fungi (rice blast) attack in 19 districts.

These forced the government to renew a 2011 memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Vietnam for 3 lakh tonnes of emergency rice imports. Three international tenders have also been floated during the last fortnight for importing 1.5 lakh tonnes more.

A day after the finance minister placed 2017-18 fiscal year's budget in parliament, Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury said rice prices went up due to sudden floods in the haor areas and that prices would come down quickly as the government took steps to import rice.

However, the government's rather late move to stabilise the rice market would yield no immediate results with local millers reluctant to sell to the food department for a non-lucrative price offered by the government. The government's rice imports are unlikely to reach ports before the end of July.  

To make matters worse, market sources told The Daily Star that prices of rice in the international market have been rising for the last two weeks.

Sources at the food ministry and the office of the Director General of Food said the government floated three international tenders in quick succession in May and in the first week of June seeking to buy 1 lakh tonnes of parboiled (Shiddo) and another 50,000 tonnes of white rice (Atap).

Dubai-based Sukhbir Agro Energy quoted the lowest price, `$427.85` a tonne, for 50,000 tonnes of parboiled rice (first tender) and Singapore-based Agrocorp International quoted the lowest price, `$406.48` a tonne, for 50,000 tonnes of white rice (second tender). 

The bids for the third tender, for 50,000 tonnes of parboiled rice, are scheduled to be opened on June 11, food ministry sources said.

As it stands now with 25 percent levies on imported rice, the government would have to pay Tk 44 for each kg of imported rice, Tk 10 more than what it offers farmers and millers.

Though the government had plans of buying 13 lakh tonnes of rice from the domestic market this boro season, its offer of Tk 34 a kg fell far short of farmers' and traders' desires. They are now selling at Tk 42-44 a kg in the domestic market.

A month has gone by since official boro procurement began and the government could only sign contracts with millers for 1.6 lakh tonnes of rice. There is no guarantee that the government would actually get that 1.6 lakh tonne of rice.

Food Minister Quamrul Islam acknowledged in parliament on Monday that the government's rice stock was low. He said the process to import six lakh tonnes of rice was underway.

Meanwhile, a recent report of the Vietnam Economic Times stated that Vietnam would sell up to 10 lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh every year until 2022, under an extended MoU first signed in 2011.

Bangladesh did not need to import rice since 2011-12 financial year but after renewing the MoU, it immediately wanted to purchase 2.5 to 3 lakh tonnes of rice and a total of 5 lakh tonnes of rice by the end of 2017, according to the Vietnam News Agency.

The government's Food Planning and Monitoring Unit's (FPMU) May 31 report stated that rice prices went up in the international market over the last fortnight. It recorded that prices of Indian, Thai and Vietnamese rice increased up to 8 percent.

Market sources said the Philippines was in the international market to buy rice along with flood-ravaged Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, which caused the price hike.

#### 2017-06-22: The curious case of rice price hike (Daily Star)
[The curious case of rice price hike]

Reaz Ahmad

A minister was telling me the other day that if people don't mind spending Tk. 300 on a cheese burger, why can't they afford a little more for rice? His comment obviously came in reference to the current high price of the staple in the retail market. Supporting his comment, someone asked, isn't this government providing the ultra-poor with food doles — giving them cushion against the high rice price in the market?

Obviously, they had essentially failed to take into account the overwhelming majority of people who are either poor, or belong to the lower middle-income bracket — who neither fall into the relatively small category of ultra-poor, nor the marginal category of burger-eaters. They are not taken care of. Any rapid and unusual surge of rice price (as is happening now) would definitely dent their wallets and dent it deep.

We'll deal with the rice-skipping, burger-munching minority of urban youths later. Let's talk about the ultra-poor first. In fact, today's abnormal hike in rice price is apparently connected to a government initiative of providing the ultra-poor with rice at Tk. 10 per kg. 

In the latter half of last year, the government started enlisting five million ultra-poor with an aim of feeding them with 7.5 lakh tonnes of rice in the subsequent five months at a rate (Tk. 10 per kg) that is a fourth of the market price. This programme has been running since September 2016 along with the government's hundred other social safety net programmes, many of which are also related to food aid.

While the government was in a frenzy doling out low-cost rice to the ultra-poor, it nearly exhausted its safe level of rice stock in the public granaries. Its food department completely failed to prepare for what was coming and did next to nothing to replenish the dried up rice stock. The stock fell below a nadir at 1.85 lakh tonnes, a 10-year low in this country. 

Independent think tanks, farm and food sector experts and economists forewarned the government not to allow such depletion of rice in its stock. But for whatever reason (only the government can explain), it allowed the freefall of rice stock. This weakened the government's position and made it difficult for any sort of market intervention, at which point profit-mongering rice traders started to benefit.

Things got further complicated when unusually early flash-floods washed away, according to the most conservative estimate, 10 lakh tonnes of rice in the northeastern back-swamps — where winter Boro rice is the only major cereal that grows in a crop year. On top of that, we lost more Boro rice in fungal attack (rice blast) in as many as 19 districts. Up until now, the Department of Agricultural Extension has not come up with any concrete estimation on fungi-induced crop losses. 

No matter how slow the government apparatuses move in making trustworthy loss assessments, rice millers and private traders were smart enough to recognise a looming supply shortage in the market. As they started to push the price up, it still didn't occur to the concerned government departments that they should intervene to ensure higher availability of rice. 

The food department rather missed a chance to replenish the rice stock, completely failed to procure paddy directly from the farmers early into the Boro harvesting season and then made a late entry into the market, that too, with non-lucrative price offers. The result was obvious. Why should rice millers — who can easily fetch Tk. 39-40 for each kilogram of rice in the open market — sell rice to the government at Tk. 34 a kg? 

After the state-run agency, Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, showed through market analysis how prices of the coarse varieties of rice jumped 47 percent in June, comparing it to the corresponding period of 2016, the government thought of buying rice from the international market. It struck at least three deals to ship in 3.5 lakh tonnes of rice; but it is unlikely to reach before early July. The government also took a long time in deciding that it should decrease a high tariff (28 percent) on rice import.

In fact, such high tariffs on rice import deterred the private sector from importing rice in a crop-loss year — which is rather unusual. One can now easily and very legitimately raise the question: Who pushed up the rice price? Why did we allow rice stock to deplete in the first place? Why didn't we replenish the stock while going full throttle with newer rice dole schemes? Why did we fail in procuring rice from the farmers early in the season? And, why did it take us so long to lower the duty on rice import?

In a country with more than 160 million people, the ultra-poor and burger-eaters are definitely a minority. I beg to differ with the notion that one should not worry about high rice prices — where burger-eaters can take care of themselves (even with the finance minister slapping a 15 percent VAT on top of the 10 percent supplementary duty on fast food) and the government takes care of the ultra-poor — because of a simple reason. There are still millions of others in this country whose quality of life is compromised when coarse rice price jumps from Tk. 30 per kg to Tk. 48. As they are now pushed up against the wall, what they will essentially have to do is consume less rice which is the only major source of energy for many and/or cut down their expenditure on other food items such as vegetables, fruits, etc.

#### 2017-07-24: Millers, wholesalers to blame for rice price spiral: USDA (Daily Star)
Sohel Parvez

Millers and wholesalers have mainly pushed rice prices higher, cashing in on supply shortages owing to floods and blast attack on the recently harvested boro rice, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

But some of the millers and wholesalers admitted that many of them slowed down purchasing and milling operations to let prices climb, said the agency in its Bangladesh Grain and Feed Update that was released on July 19.

Flooding damaged over one million tonnes of boro rice crop across 400,000 hectares of wetlands, locally known as haor, in the northeastern regions and lowlands in nine districts, according to the USDA.

The loss was aggravated by a fungi or neck blast attack on a limited area of boro rice crop in several northern and southern districts of the country, it added.

Subsequently, the USDA lowered its boro rice production estimate to 17.8 million tonnes.

The damage from flooding reduced harvests enough to drive the farm gate prices of paddy up 29-60 percent last year.

The surge was further fuelled by some traders hoarding paddy to drive prices even higher. Despite the higher farm gate prices for paddy, farmers had small net margins after deducting losses caused by the flooding and disease.

“In the end, it was largely millers and wholesalers who pushed rice prices up.”

The USDA's report comes at a time when the prices of coarse rice, which is mostly consumed by the poor and lower middle-income people, dropped marginally from its historic high of Tk 47.30 each kilogram in June.

The retail prices of coarse rice were Tk 42-45 per kilogram yesterday thanks to increased imports after reduction of import duty by the government to 10 percent from previous 28 percent.

Despite the fall, coarse rice prices were 36 percent higher yesterday from a year earlier, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

Besides, the massive cutback in open market sales of rice last fiscal year fuelled price speculation.

The USDA said rice prices have been increasing since August last year, and the recent aman and boro rice harvest did little to relieve the pressure: prices remain their highest in eight years.

Rice prices began creeping up last year after the government hiked import duty to ensure farmers get better prices for their crops. Later, depleting stocks, particularly in public warehouses, coupled with low import caused the rice prices to remain higher.

To contain the price spiral and raise stock in public warehouses, the government also started buying the staple from global market for the first time in five years.

The agency said Bangladesh's rice import would rise to 1.2 million tonnes in the current fiscal year thanks to robust consumer demand, expansion of the food safety net programme, lower public stocks, and relaxed trade and financial policy.

Rice imports slumped 48 percent year-on-year to 133,000 tonnes in fiscal 2016-17.  Since July 1, 102,800 tonnes of the grain were imported, according to food ministry data.

#### 2017-08-10: Govt to further slash duty on rice import (Daily Star)
Goes for deal with Thailand to buy the staple
[Govt to further slash duty on rice import]

In a desperate bid to stabilise rice price, the government has decided to further reduce the duty on import of the staple and strike a deal with Thailand to buy rice.

Meanwhile, private importers, anticipating the duty slash, are delaying in having the already imported rice released at the country's two main land ports -- Hili in Dinajpur and Benapole in Jessore.

Over 200 trucks loaded with some 7,000 tonnes of rice were standing still at the ports yesterday.

As rice prices continue to remain high, the food ministry on July 25 proposed to allow import of the staple on zero tariffs.  

On Tuesday, the commerce ministry informed the parliamentary standing committee concerned that the government would halve the import duty from 10 percent.

Bahauddin Nasim, a member of the parliamentary body on the ministry, told The Daily Star yesterday although the food ministry insisted on lifting the duty altogether, the government would keep a five percent duty on rice import.

Till last night, the National Board of Revenue, however, did not receive any communications in this regard.

But speculation over an imminent duty cut prompted private importers to go slow with the release of already imported rice consignments from India.

On June 20, the government reduced duty on rice import from 28 percent to 10 percent. As a result, the country witnessed over 2.4 lakh tonnes of rice import in the last one and a half months. This volume is almost double the entire volume of rice imported by private traders in the last financial year.   

Mamunur Rashid, an importer, told our Dinajpur correspondent Kongkon Karmaker yesterday that they were taking time in unloading the imported rice as they heard that the government would lower the duty further.

“We are waiting for a final decision from the government,” said Rashedul Islam, a Clearing and Forwarding Agent at Hili Land port.

As many as 138 loaded trucks were parked at the port, said Sohrab Hossain, public relation officer of Panama Port Link Ltd at Hili. Import of rice would go up further once the duty is cut off, he said.

Our Benapole correspondent Mohsin Milon reported that 65 rice-laden trucks were kept in port area as importers were waiting to reap the duty-cut benefit.

Meanwhile, a Thai delegation is due in the city today to sign a government-to-government (G2G) deal with the food ministry for export of the staple to Bangladesh.

However, ministry sources yesterday declined to reveal the price at which the government is going to buy the rice from Thailand, which in last month had asked for a high price (`$500` a tonne). The price, however, was not agreed by Bangladesh.

Besides, a Cambodian official delegation is also due sometime next week to decide on rice price. Last week, a MoU (memorandum of understanding) was signed between Bangladesh and Cambodia for the import of

10 lakh tonnes of rice from the Southeast Asian country in next five years.

After with Cambodia, if the deal is signed with Thailand today, it would be the third such import deal in two months since the government approved import of 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice from Vietnam under a separate G2G agreement.

Besides, over the past two months, the Directorate General of Food floated seven international tenders seeking to import an additional 3.5 lakh tonnes of rice.

The moves come long after the crop loss in the March flashflood, which ravaged the backswamps in the country's northeastern region where 90 percent of standing Boro crops, totalling over 10 lakh tonnes, were damaged. Fungal attacks in at least 19 districts also caused crop loss in the last Boro season.

With the Cambodian deal signed, 8.5 lakh tonnes of rice is now lined up for import, which still falls short of a projected import need of 12 lakh tonnes. A recent US Department of Agriculture projection, however, put the figure at 15 lakh tonnes in the current fiscal.

The food ministry's move also comes at a time when end-season rice stock in public granaries dropped to a six-year low and market price of coarse rice shot up to as high as Tk 48 a kg in June-July. This is a 47 percent rise from the price during the same period last year.

Despite government moves and increased imports by the private sector, a Trading Corporation of Bangladesh's market monitoring report shows that the price of coarse rice has remained static at Tk 45 a kg for over two weeks.

#### 2017-08-18: Rice price goes up (Daily Star)
Millers, traders cite public procurement, flood as reasons

Star Report

Prices of rice have edged up amid the government's ongoing purchase, falling supply from farmers and flood in the country's northern region, said millers and traders.

In Dhaka, retail prices of coarse rice rose by 6.45 percent to Tk 32-34 per kg from Tk 30-32 a month ago, according to the Department of Agricultural Marketing.

Prices of the staple also soared in Rangpur and Dinajpur due to supply shortages as millers prefer delivering to government warehouses at Tk 32 a kg, reports our Dinajpur correspondent.

Fine rice, including miniket and paizam, has also become dearer. A 50 kg bag of fine rice was selling between Tk 2,400 and 2,600 at a rice wholesale market in Mahiganj of Rangpur town on Sunday, up from between Tk 2,000 and Tk 2,200 two to three weeks ago, said traders.

According to some buyers and traders, prices of coarse rice have increased by nearly Tk 6 per kg in some areas of Rangpur and Dinajpur over the last two to three weeks. On Sunday, the commodity was trading at up to Tk 33 each kg, up from Tk 26 two to three weeks ago.

“How come prices go up so fast? Is there any rule?” questioned an annoyed Ibrahim Ali in Bahadurbazaar of Dinajpur town.

He claimed of buying a kg of BR-11 rice for Tk 33 this week, which he could get for Tk 26 two weeks ago at the rice markets in Bahadurbazaar. He blamed syndication of traders for the price hike.

Visiting the markets in the area on Sunday, The Daily Star found that coarse and medium-grain rice was traded at between Tk 1,600 and Tk 1,800 per 50 kgs. Some traders said the same quantity of rice was sold between Tk 1,300 and 1,500 two to three weeks ago.

“The current price is quite high for me,” said Masud Rana, a rickshaw puller in Rangpur. He urged the government to look into the matter.

Early this month, the Directorate General of Food started procuring rice as per contracts with millers. The food office aims to buy five lakh tonnes of parboiled rice and 50,000 tonnes of sundried rice from the boro crop, harvesting of which ended in June.

The office earlier bought 6.69 lakh tonnes of paddy at Tk 23 per kg during the boro season.

As of August 16, the food office bought 44,763 tonnes of rice, according to food ministry data. The government procures rice to create a stock and to give price support to growers.

KM Layek Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Auto, Major and Husking Mills Association, said rice prices increased owing to rising prices of paddy. The government's procurement of paddy was the main reason behind the price spiral, he pointed out.

Prices of almost all varieties of paddy rose by up to Tk 300 each maund (40 kilograms) since the end of the boro season, he said, adding that the market saw poor supply of coarse paddy since the beginning of public procurement.

He said marginal farmers do not have paddy in their hand now. “Big-scale farmers and traders who hold back their stock now have paddy,” he added.

Some traders said big-scale farmers and stockists have slowed down the supply of paddy assuming that import of rice would be very expensive due to duty hike by the government.

“Many millers are also buying from local markets to deliver rice to public warehouses,” said Layek.

The government imposed 25 percent duty on rice import in the current fiscal year to protect interest of farmers.

Sheikh Abul Kashem, secretary of Rangpur Rice Millers Association, said big merchants were holding their stock. He hoped supply would improve by the end of this month.

Abdur Rashid, owner of Matin Rice at Mohammdapur Krishi Market in Dhaka, said prices of the staple have been on the rise since the Eid-ul-Fitr early last month. He attributed the price hike to higher paddy prices.

Prices of fine and medium quality rice increased by Tk 4-6 per kg since May this year owing to spike in paddy prices, said Nirod Boron Saha, a wholesaler and commission agent in Naogaon, one of the main rice trading hubs in the country's north.

Saha, also president of Dhan O Chal Aratdar O Byabosayee Samity in Naogaon, blamed the price spiral on slow supply of paddy from big farmers and traders.

He said higher prices of coarse rice might affect low-income and working class people.

“But the price hike is not abnormal. Increase in prices appears to be tolerable from the view point of increased wages of day labourers,” he added.

Failing to import parboiled (Shiddo) rice from Myanmar due to high price, the government yesterday approved another deal to import 50,000 tonnes of rice through international tender.

A Thai-based company has agreed to provide Bangladesh with parboiled rice at `$438` per tonne, `$47` less than the asking price of Myanmar.

Meanwhile, a day after three ministers held a meeting with rice traders, millers and importers in the capital and fulfilled some of their demands, rice prices at wholesale markets started showing a downtrend.

Coarse rice prices, which shot up to Tk 47/48 a kg in the wholesale markets and up to Tk 54 a kg in the retail markets, came down by Tk 4 a kg at the wholesale level yesterday.

Market sources attributed the price fall to release of rice by many of the millers from their godown stocks.

Importers at Benapole land port told The Daily Star that once the circular allowing use of poly-bags instead of jute sacks for rice packing reaches there, the prices would fall further. 

Bangladesh Rice Millers' Association President Abdur Rashid said consumers at the retail level would get price fall benefits in three to four days.

A visiting Myanmar official delegation on Monday agreed to provide Bangladesh with just one lakh tonnes of white (Atap) rice at `$442` a tonne but didn't budge from their asking price of `$485` per tonne for parboiled rice.

Amid a spiraling of rice prices in domestic markets, the government struck deals, both through tenders and government-to-government arrangements (G2G), to import as much as 9 lakh tonnes of the staple, two-third of which is white rice.  

While allocating this white rice for an extended Open Market Sale (OMS) operation, the government found that the sale of subsidised food grains drew little response from people here who prefer parboiled rice over white one. 

Food Secretary Kaikobad Hossain told reporters in Dhaka that of the total expected import volume, two lakh tonnes had so far reached public food granaries while another 1.5 lakh tonnes were expected to reach land ports soon.

Some 5.5 lakh tonne more rice would be brought in by November, Kaikobad added.   

The government had decided to import as much as 20 lakh tonnes of food grains (15 lakh tonnes of rice and 5 lakh tonnes of wheat) in the ongoing fiscal year following crop loss in excess of 20 lakh tonnes due to haor flashfloods and rice blasts. 

Though it succeeded striking G2G deals with Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar for importing rice, most of it was white rice. Government efforts to sign deals with India and Thailand for import of parboiled rice did not yield results as both the countries asked for exorbitant prices -- over `$500` per tonne.

Asked why the government went for relatively pricey imports through G2G arrangement while rice is available at cheaper rates through open tenders, the food secretary yesterday told reporters that there was no quality concern in case of G2G rice, while private parties on winning bids sometimes tended to compromise the quality.

Besides, the government-to-government deals guarantee quicker shipment, he added.
OMS & FOOD FRIENDLY PROGRAMME

A day after the food minister's announcement that the OMS programme would be extended from district to upazila level, the subsidised food grains sale programme could not be launched in most upazilas yesterday.

In most of the areas, dealers selected by the food department for OMS programme were busy depositing money in banks and collecting the rice allocated from the government silos in their respective districts. 

Our correspondents from Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Natore sent dispatches that dealers would begin the OMS operation today.

In another development, the government postponed distribution of rice at Tk 10 a kg among 50 lakh ultra poor across the country due to insufficient rice stock in public grannaries.

Food officials said the priority was to operate OMS programme on a wider scale now over Food Friendly Programme. Together these two programmes would require more than 6 lakh tonnes of rice but the government's food reserve currently has only 3.4 lakh tonnes of rice.

#### 2017-10-23: Why are rice prices rising? (Daily Tribune)

Why are rice prices rising?
Will there be enough? MEHEDI HASAN
When the public fears that prices will rise, they do


The rice price has increased significantly over the past year, and there is much discussion as to why this happened. A brief review of the rice market concepts: The farmer sells paddy to whoever buys it and this ends up at the rice millers.

Of course a lot of rice is milled locally in small mills for consumption in rural areas. The price of paddy will vary with location and time but the paddy market is reasonably integrated.

There is another price ex mill for milled rice. There will be variations of quality rices so this ex mill, wholesale price will cover a range of values. The urban wholesale markets will have prices slightly different that the ex mill price due to transportation and trade mark ups.

Finally, there is a retail price, at which the consumer purchases the rice. It is this retail price for coarse rice that we will focus on as a representative price for the whole spectrum of prices for different rice types. All of these prices should move more or less together as if one gets too high demand will decline and the price will fall.

The rice price in Bangladesh is closely connected to the Indian rice price. If the taka/rupee exchange rate and the import duties are stable then the Bangladesh price will track the Indian price. This will not be exact, but if the prices differ too much, rice will move across the border.

There is always potential for movement of rice in the informal transport channels. This channel will move rice in either direction according to the price. There is really a single market for rice between India and Bangladesh and price variations are temporary and will be removed by this arbitrage of rice moving both in formal and informal transport channels.

In July 2014, the price of coarse rice was Tk3.1 per kg, and fluctuated around Tk3 per kg during the year. The price declined slowly during the period July 2015 to June 2016 with the price fluctuating around Tk2.6 per kg.

    Government actions over the past year are correct: Explain that there is plenty of rice, import more rice, reduce the import duty

Then the price increased rapidly from Tk2.6 per kg in July 2016 to Tk4 per kg by June 2017, an increase of 53%. An increase of that size will increase the urban CPI by 3% and the rural CPI by 12%. The official estimates however, do not indicate such increases.

The typical explanation for this increase was the reduced availability of rice from the floods and the outbreak of blast disease. Other explanations were that the millers were not releasing milled rice into the market and that “syndicates” were withholding rice, driving the rice price higher.

In Asia, the standard explanation for rising food prices is that the business men in the food chain are withholding food from the market, having formed a conspiracy to manipulate the price. The standard Asian government response is to attack the millers and the traders.

To send government officials to markets to discover and discipline these monopoly “blood suckers” as they are usually known. This Kabuki ritual is performed every time there is a spike in the grain prices.

Most of the time, no one takes this very seriously, but it gives everyone someone to blame.Conspiracies involving many businessmen are impossible to maintain; in Bangladesh, a conspiracy with more than three persons soon becomes public knowledge.

A few words about rice production and consumption

First, estimates from the BSS and the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that Bangladesh produces about 34 million mt of rice every year. The consumption is about 26 million mt. There is some retention of paddy.

However about 15% of the rice crop is just lost in the process of milling or trading. The implication of this is that rice stocks at any time are typically 6-8 million mt. There is always quite a large amount of rice inside Bangladesh. There are supplies in every house, in every retail shop, on every farm as well as well as in the millers’ warehouses.

Bengal has had its share of crises over the rice price. Some of these have been disasters leading to famine. Some have led to widespread intervention in the rice economy. The research of Amartya Sen on Bengal famines sets out the reasons and authoritative explanation of these price crisis that have occurred from time to time.

The reasoning emerged from a determination that even in the most terrible famine there was plenty of rice available. What drives the changes in rice prices is the expectation that prices are going to rise.

When there is widespread belief that there is a shortage of rice and the price is going to rise, then the public reacts by buying more rice. This action results in higher prices. The expectations of the public are influenced by what is believed about the availability of rice and also by an individual’s idea about what other people think.

If you think that everyone believes the rice price is going up, then you buy more rice now even if you think that there is plenty of rice in the country. Sen has taught us that one should look to expectations when there are sharp price spikes.

During this past year, there was widespread belief that there was a shortage of rice. This came from reporting on crop losses and low levels of rice in government stores. The amount of rice that might have been lost from floods was never more than 2-3 million mt and even this level is now probably proving too high.

The government rice stores always get a lot of attention, but the level of stocks is less than 10% of production — significant but not that important. In addition, there is always reporting about the efforts of the millers to withhold rice and drive the price up.

All of this together generates expectations in the public that the price of rice is going to rise, and leads to increased stocks of rice being purchased and held everywhere.

The higher demands arising from these expectations then increase the rice price.

Government actions over the past year are correct: Explain that there is plenty of rice, import more rice, reduce the import duty. All of these actions may lead the public to change their expectations away from increasing prices.

Ultimately, the rice prices will return to the level established by the Indian rice market price, the taka/rupee exchange rate and customs charges.

#### 2017-12-24 Rice price hike makes half a million more people poor(Prothom Alo)
Staff Correspondent | Update: 18:34, Dec 24, 2017

rice sacks / Prothom Alo More than half a million Bangladeshis have been poor once again due to rise in rice price in recent months, says an economic review report.

The 520,000 people, according to the report, have gone back to 'below poverty line' in the past several months for the rice price-hike.

Floods and supply shortfall as a restult of inadequate imports have triggerred the rise in rice price by more than 30 per cent during the period, the report mentioned.

And the price-hike caused increase in poverty by 0.32 per cent, found the review by South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM).

"It is a matter of concern that rice price rose despite imports of rice. After the recent floods, the poor did not get the scope to adjust with the rice price hike by raising their income," SANEM's executive director Selim Raihan said while presenting the report at a press conference at BRAC Centre Inn in Dhaka on Saturday.

SANEM's analysis of rise in povery was based on the poverty estimate by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics that showed the rate of poverty in the country was 24.3 per cent in 2016.

Without directly rejecting the SANEM analysis, member of the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission Shamsul Alam said some 500,000 people are not a big figure in the army of 38 million poor in the country.

"it's not a matter of concern," he said.

He also acknowledged that rice price hike deals a big blow to the lower income group of people, as they spend 80 per cent of their income to buy foods.

The Planning Commission member, however, expressed his confidence that those who came back below the poverty line would be able to overcome the situation once the prices are adjusted.

Market sources said the rice price rose by Tk 2-3 a kilogram only in the past two weeks.

The country's rice import bill increased five times.

#### 2017-12-25: People suffered when rice price crossed Tk 50 (Daily Star)
Says Muhith

Staff Correspondent
People faced some difficulties when the price of rice crossed Tk 50 a kg and might have run out of their savings to cope with the high price, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said yesterday. 

He said there was no doubt that people had suffered because of the high price of rice. 

"We also wanted the price to increase to some extent. It is good from that point. But when it went beyond Tk 50 a kg, some people faced problems and might have run out of their savings,” he told reporters at the secretariat.

Muhith's comments came in response to a think-tank's new research finding that says 520,000 people have fallen into poverty due to sharp increase in the price of the staple this year.

Using a computable general equilibrium model, Dhaka-based South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (SANEM) on Saturday said it found a 35 percent increase in the price of rice and the results show that there is likely to be a rise in headcount poverty rate by 0.32 percentage points due to the rice price hike this year.

This means that 520,000 people have fallen into poverty because of increasing the rice price, according to SANEM.

This report should not be trusted. One should wait at least for a year to find out whether the poverty rate has gone up or down, Muhith said, adding that his position is that he will not accept the report until a year passes.  

Rice prices hit a record high mid-August, triggered by a rumour of India banning export, by a drop production owing to crop damage caused by recurrent floods, depleting public stocks and inadequate supply from millers and traders.

On September 16, retail prices of coarse grains, consumed mainly by the poor and low income groups, shot up to Tk 50-54 a kg in Dhaka city, according to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

The prices, however, have come down below Tk 50 a kg thanks to huge imports and availability of subsidised rice through open market sales. 

Yesterday, coarse rice was sold at Tk 44-46 a kg, which was Tk 40-45 a month ago and Tk 35-38 a year ago, according to the TCB's market monitoring report.

Prices of fine rice varieties rose 26 percent year-on-year yesterday and coarse price 23.29 percent, showed TCB data.

#### 2017-12-27: Syndicates behind rice price volatility!(Financial Express)



Shahiduzzaman Khan | Wednesday, 27 December 2017

Finance Minister AMA Muhith, of late, admitted that the common people were suffering because of the high price of rice. When the price crossed Tk 50 a kilogramme (kg), some poor people might have run out of their savings, he said.

The finance minister's observations came in the wake of the Dhaka-based think-tank SANEM's (South Asian Network on Economic Modelling) finding that  520,000 people have fallen into poverty due to sharp increase in the price of the staple this year. These people, according to the study, have gone back to 'below poverty line' in the past several months due to rice price hike.

Using a computable general equilibrium model, SANEM said last week it found a 35 per cent increase in the price of rice and the results show that there is a possibility of a rise in headcount poverty rate by 0.32 percentage points because of rice price hike this year.

Rice prices did hit a record high in the middle of August. During the middle of September, retail prices of coarse grains, consumed mainly by the poor and low income groups, shoot up to Tk 50-54 a kg in Dhaka city. The prices, however, came down below Tk 50 a kg the following month thanks to imports in large volumes and availability of subsidised rice through open market sales.

This week, coarse rice is being sold at Tk 44-46 a kg, which was Tk 40-45 a month ago, and Tk 35-38 a year ago. Prices of fine rice varieties rose 26 per cent year-on-year and coarse price 23.29 per cent. In line with finer varieties, the prices of coarse varieties of rice also increased last week.

Rice price hike has dealt a severe blow to the lower income groups of people, as they spend 80 per cent of their income to buy foods. However, the government believes that those who slumped below the poverty line would be able to overcome the situation once the prices are adjusted.

Analysts say such price hike is 'abnormal' and blame the rice trading syndicates as responsible for this. There is no reason why prices should rise during the harvesting season in the country and when imports reached an all-time high. However, traders attributed the hike to a record price surge of paddy during this ongoing Aman harvesting season amid expected low production of the staple.

Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) also termed the price hike of rice abnormal during this harvesting season, in spite of huge imports. Its market reports showed that the milling cost of Swarna variety of rice will not be over Tk 39.8 a kg. But the variety is still being traded at Tk 54 a kg in the city retail markets.

Consumers usually expect a decline in prices during the harvesting season, which is absent this year. The overall production might witness a decline following the two spells of flooding that damaged the crops in both Boro and Aman seasons this year. But the fact remains that there is no supply shortage of rice now following the domestic harvest, large imports and almost stable international prices.

Meanwhile, the government should take action to minimise the price gap between the farmers' end and the consumers' end because the current paddy prices are all-time high considering any Aman harvesting seasons in the past.

Nearly 55 per cent of Aman harvest has been completed out of 5.56 million hectares of Aman coverage by December 20. The agriculture ministry is expecting 15.0 million tonnes of Aman rice this season.

The government claims that there is sufficient stock of rice now. It has brought 0.4 million tonnes of rice while 1.2 million tonnes more will be imported during the remaining period of this fiscal. According to SANEM, the government should formulate a 'rice policy' with respect to production, import, supply management and go for strategic agreements with rice exporting countries.

Despite accelerated economic growth in recent years, there has been much slower progress in poverty reduction because of slow employment generation, poor public spending on education and healthcare, and growing inequality. Recent rice price hike has made the poverty reduction efforts quite worrying.

What is apparent is that the millers, importers and their allied traders have hiked the price through syndicates. They need to be brought under close scrutiny to combat any artificial price hike. The government should, in the meantime raise its stock of rice to at least 1.5 million tonnes to put some impact on the mainstream market so that limited income groups could afford rice at reasonable prices.

CAB report says
Star Online Report
Living cost rose by 8.44 percent in Dhaka in 2017 because of hike in prices of rice, vegetables, house rents, electricity, gas as well as other services, said Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB).

The latest spike was higher than in 2016 when cost of living rose by 6.47 percent and cost of services went up by 5.81 percent respectively.

The consumers’ representative body said it has not included expenses on education, health and real transport in its estimate.

The CAB prepared the report by collecting price data from 15 markets in Dhaka on 114 food items and 22 products for daily usage. It also took into account the cost of 14 services including gas, electricity and water to prepare the report.

Food prices particularly rice soared at higher rate in 2017 than the previous year, said CAB President Ghulam Rahman at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters’ Unity (DRU), unveiling CAB’s annual report on cost of living in Dhaka.

In 2017, cost of services including electricity, gas and water increased by 7.17 percent compared to the figures from 2016, said CAB.

House rents went up by 8.13 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, it added.

#### Jan 02, 2018 Right to food security
Oli Md. Abdullah Chowdhury

A report published in The Daily Star (December 23, 2017) regarding food security situation in Bangladesh revealed that Bangladesh stood 89th in the Global Food Security Index-2017, as the last one among the South-Asian countries.The Global Food Security Index considers the core issues of affordability, availability, and quality across the 113 countries. The index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model, constructed from 28 unique indicators, that measures these drivers of food security across both developing and developed countries.

Article 15 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic Of Bangladesh state- “it shall be a fundamental responsibility of the state to attain, through planned economic growth, a constant increase of productive forces and a steady improvement in the material and cultural standard of living of the people, with a view to securing to its citizen- the provision of basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, shelter, education and medical care”. Bangladesh is vulnerable to climatic disaster and repeated floods caused great damage to rice crops this year. A section of rice millers allegedly hoarded rice and deliberately hiked prices after the country lost crops -- primarily estimated at 20 lakh tonnes -- to flashfloods in Haor areas and fungal attack in the last Boro season.

The National Food Policy of 2006 represents an important departure from the past by applying a comprehensive and integrated approach to food security, including the availability, access and utilisation dimension of food security. Policy has outlined following three main objectives:

Objective 1: Adequate and stable supply of safe and nutritious food

Objective 2: Increased purchasing power and access to food of the people

Objective 3: Adequate nutrition for all individuals, especially women and children

However, Cox's Bazar district administration imposed a weeklong ban on NGOs involved in distributing aid to Rohingyas at Ukhia and Teknaf starting from December 11, 2017. Interestingly, government circular stated that the amount of food and non-food items being distributed by the NGOs among the refugees were more than what they require. Food availability does not necessarily guarantee food security and moreover, refugee children largely suffer from malnutrition.

Let alone refugees, a large segment of Bangladeshi population still suffers from food insecurity. Recent price hike had an impact on food security and overall poverty situation. At least 5.2 lakh people have fallen into poverty because of rice price hike, according to a recent study of the South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (SANEM). It has also caused a rise in head count poverty rate by 0.32 percentage points in past few months in the country.

There is a demand to promulgate food security act. Most of the countries of the world have right to food law but Bangladesh doesn't currently have one. It is high time to codify a law to ensure food security.

#### Jan 03, 2018: Dhaka City in 2017: Rise in living cost highest in 4yrs
Last year saw 8.44pc increase, says CAB analysis
Dhaka City Living Cost in 2017
Staff Correspondent
The cost of living in the capital hit a four-year high in 2017 due to spiralling prices of rice, vegetables, electricity, gas and other services as well as rising house rent, the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) said yesterday.

The city residents saw their living costs go up by 8.44 percent last year compared to that in the previous year, it said.

The voluntary organisation urged the government to form a separate wing or division under the Prime Minister's Office or the commerce ministry to keep prices of 12-15 essentials within the reach of the low-income and poor families.

“Most of the people were deprived of the fruits of the country's overall development because of the price hike of essentials, including rice, in 2017. Many people are suffering due to high food prices. Savings of many families are falling. An urgent remedy is necessary,” CAB President Ghulam Rahman said while presenting the CAB report on living cost in 2017 at the Dhaka Reporters Unity.

Living cost of the two crore city dwellers hit the highest since 2014 when it rose by 6.82 percent, according to the CAB.

The CAB report is based on price data on 114 food items and 22 everyday products collected from 15 markets in the capital. It also took into account the prices of 14 services, including gas, electricity and water.

The report, however, did not include the education and health expenses of the city residents.

Earlier in 2013, the cost of living had shot up by 11 percent compared to that in the previous year because of increase in the prices of fish, spices, rice, pulses, onion, electricity and petroleum, said the CAB.

Prof Shamsul Alam, energy adviser to the CAB, said around 12 crore of the country's 16 crore people earn `$2` a day, and price hike of essentials seriously affected the lives of this section of the population who represents the low-income and poor people.

“The soaring cost shows lack of competition in the market, high profit motive, corruption and extortion in almost every stage of the supply chain of commodities,” he said at the press conference.

The CAB said the average price of rice soared by 20.4 percent in 2017 -- the highest since 2011 -- from that a year ago. And prices of coarse rice rose higher than that of fine rice.

Architect and CAB's complaint cell convener Mubasshar Hussain said the increase in prices of coarse rice has hit the poor and low-income people hard.

The CAB noted that rice millers and big traders hiked prices of the staple, cashing in on flood-induced losses of crops and depleting stockpile at public granaries last year.

They would not have got the scope for increasing prices by creating an artificial supply shortage if the government had built adequate stocks of rice, said the consumer rights organisation.

Onion saw the highest price hike last year, followed by other vegetables, household gas, rice, liquid milk and beef. Besides, house rent soared by 8.14 percent and electricity by 6.44 percent in 2017 from that a year ago.

However, prices of some items such as lentil, egg and potato fell last year compared to that in the previous year.

Referring to the hike of gas and electricity prices by the government, it said, “The CAB thinks the decision to increase prices was not logical and justified.”

Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission increased the electricity price in November, and the new rate became effective from December last year. 

On transport, the CAB said there was no mentionable improvement in public transport last year.

It also mentioned that healthcare facilities have increased but questions still remain about the quality and costs of healthcare.

The report also touched on the issue of repeated leaks of question papers of various examinations last year.

The CAB noted that Bangladesh's economy is growing more than 7 percent annually and per capita income has exceeded `$1,600`.

The number of poor people has also declined remarkably. Yet, around two crore people are still suffering from poverty, said the non-profit organisation.

“There is no alternative to keeping the prices of essentials within the reach of the poor,” added the CAB president.

#### Jan 03, 2018: Inflation eases in Dec
Inflation of Bangladesh in 2017
Star Business Report
Inflation came down to 5.83 percent in December, from 5.91 percent a month ago, riding on a decline in non-food prices, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal yesterday released the data for November and December.

In December food inflation increased slightly but as non-food inflation decreased, the overall inflation fell.

Food inflation in December rose by 4 basis points and stood at 7.13 percent. But in November it fell by 53 basis points to 7.09 percent.

Food inflation went down by 25 basis points to 7.62 percent in October after hitting a 38-month high of 7.87 percent in September.

Food inflation declined for three months in a row but in December it increased as rice prices went up.

Prices of many other essential commodities, including onion, also marked a rise stoking the inflation rate. 

According to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh data, coarse rice sold for Tk 44 to Tk 46 per kilogramme in Dhaka yesterday -- a rise by 5.88 percent from a month back and by 23 percent from a year ago.

In recent months, rice prices rose to record highs, reflecting dwindling supplies following flood-induced losses to the main boro crop, coupled with reduced production and imports in 2016.

In September, coarse rice price in Dhaka city was Tk 52.54 a kg in contrast to Tk 34.62 a year earlier.

In August 2014, food inflation was 7.67 percent and gradually decreased to below 4 percent. But from January last year, it started to creep up to more than 6 percent, crossing the 7 percent mark in May. It remained above 7 percent in the following five months except June.

According to BBS data, food inflation in rural areas rose by only 1 basis point to stand at 7.08 percent. However, in urban areas inflation increased by 7 basis points to 7.22 percent.

When asked whether the BBS data reflected the real picture of the rise in food prices, Kamal said the BBS conducted the survey and prepared the inflation data on the basis of living index throughout the country.

The prices of rice and onion increased and this reflected in the overall index.

The minister said, from October to December, general inflation was 5.93 percent whereas it was 5.32 percent in the same period last year.

Non-food inflation went down by 25 basis points to 3.85 percent in December from 4.10 percent a month ago, according to the BBS data.

But in November, non-food inflation went up by 49 basis points compared to that in October.

Non-food inflation went up by 17 basis points to 3.61 percent in October from 3.44 percent a month ago, according to the BBS data. Non-food inflation in December fell in both rural and urban areas.

Inflation decelerated to 5.44 percent in the last fiscal year, aided by prudent monetary management and weak aggregate demand. The government has set the inflation target at 5.5 percent for fiscal 2017-18.

#### Jan 04, 2018: Rice imports hit two-decade high
Soaring imports fail to rein in prices
Bangladesh Rice imports
Sohel Parvez
Rice imports scaled a two-decade high in the first half of the fiscal year as private importers rushed to make profit from higher prices resulting from huge crop losses amid three episodes of floods.

Imports of the staple stood at 22.59 lakh tonnes in July-December of fiscal 2017-18, the highest since 1998-99 when a record 30.67 lakh tonnes of rice were bought from external sources in the full fiscal year, according to food ministry data.

The government imported 5.08 lakh tonnes of rice in July-December.

Analysts said imports soared in the face of speculation of a decline in yield of current aman and low stocks of previous boro rice at private mills. A slash in import duty to 2 percent from 10 percent in August gave a boost to imports.

Analysts said higher imports will increase supply, thus helping to stabilise the market and benefit consumers. But the government should be watchful so that higher imports do not hurt farmers by creating a glut in the market, they added.

“Imports will continue as prices are higher in Bangladesh compared to India,” said Citta Majumder, managing director of Majumder Group of Industries.

Food ministry data showed letters of credits to import 32 lakh tonnes of rice were opened until December 23 last year.

The buoyancy in imports continues at a time when farmers have harvested most of the aman crop, which accounts for 38 percent of the country's annual rice production.

The soaring imports and the harvest of aman crop have increased the availability of rice. However, prices of the staple still remain high.

In Dhaka, retail prices of the coarse and medium quality rice, consumed by the majority of the population, were Tk 44 to Tk 56 a kg yesterday, according to data from the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

Yesterday's prices of coarse and medium quality grain were 6 percent and 4 percent higher from a month ago, show TCB data.

Majumder said there is high speculation that aman output declined in 2017 from a year ago.

The government decision to buy rice at Tk 39 per kg and millers' rush to buy aman paddy contributed to the higher prices, he said.    

Majumder said the number of buyers is high this year. Many millers don't have any stock of previous boro paddy and entered the market to buy aman paddy to keep their mills running.

A US Department of Agriculture report in November forecasted a drop in aman production to 1.3 crore tonnes in the fiscal year. The agency also said overall output will decline.  

In December, the Food and Agriculture Organization said total paddy production would fall in 2017 by 3 percent to 5.08 crore tonnes, a five-year low. It estimated paddy output at 5.21 crore tonnes in 2016.

“In Bangladesh, three episodes of severe floods during 2017 affected large areas of the country, particularly northern districts, causing losses to the two main boro and aman crops, which together account for more than 90 percent of total annual output,” said the FAO.

Rezaul Karim Talukder, poverty and social protection policy adviser of the FAO Bangladesh, said the floods and a disease infestation in aman crop might have caused a loss of 15-20 lakh tonnes of rice.

He said imports are rising as there is demand from the private and public sectors.

Talukder expected the prices of rice to become stable for increased imports and the harvest of aman.

Quazi Shahabuddin, a former director general of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said the private sector is importing because of the price gaps between domestic and international markets.

He stressed ensuring a bumper boro harvest in the coming season to bring down prices of rice.

#### Jan 04, 2018:  A city only for the rich?
Living costs in Dhaka have soared
[A city only for the rich?]

Last year, the cost of living in Dhaka hit a four-year high. It rose by an alarming 8.44 percentage points from that of 2016, as revealed by the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB)—which brought out a report on living costs in 2017—at the Dhaka Reporters Unity on Tuesday. With rising prices of essentials and basic amenities, living in Dhaka city is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many.

Prices have gone up so much that any further increase in food prices, electricity or gas risks hurting the economy badly. The nationwide hike in rice prices last year, for example, seriously affected the people, particularly low-income groups. The signs of soaring rice prices—weak food reserve, corruption and speculation among some quarters, etc.—were there all along and could have been mitigated had the food ministry stepped in and taken timely measures.

Last year, we also saw an increase in gas prices which would have gone up further had the High Court not declared the second phase gas hike for household consumers illegal. CAB has asserted that the increase in gas and electricity prices by the government was not justified. Along with all this, house rent and healthcare costs have also risen.

With costs on all sides going up, has quality of life in Dhaka improved proportionately for the vast majority who are barely making ends meet? The answer is of course in the negative. The trend of arbitrary price hikes of essentials and basic amenities and shifting a significant burden on to consumers can no longer continue. Living affordability must be prioritised by the government and the recommendations put forward by CAB—which include direct purchase of rice from farmers by government and involving the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh in import and sale of commodities—should be taken into serious consideration.

#### Jan 07, 2018: Food stock rises
Cut in subsidised rice distribution, rise in import key reasons
Rice
Star file photo
Rejaul Karim Byron
The government's food stock saw a rise this year compared to the same period last year. This was mainly due to a significant reduction in food distribution to the ultra-poor and a rise in rice import.

According to data from the food ministry, food stock on January 2 this year increased by 1.17 lakh tonnes and stood at 8.33 lakh tonnes, of which rice stock was 5.3 lakh tonnes.

The figure was 7.16 lakh tonnes on the same day last year.

Two consecutive floods depleted the government's rice stock to historic low of just 1.5 lakh tonnes in the beginning of July last year. 

Low production also led to an increase in rice prices in local markets and the government could not collect one fourth of its domestic procurement target of boro rice.

As a result, the government was compelled to cut public food distribution.

The data shows that 10.29 lakh tonnes of food--rice and wheat--was distributed among the poor between July 1 and December 2, 2016. But the government, under the public food distribution system (PFDS), could provide only 6.64 lakh tonnes in the corresponding period last year.

The fall in amount was mainly because of the government's failure to continue its Tk 10-a-kg rice distribution programme in the second half of 2017, even after rescheduling the date twice.

The government introduced the programme in 2016 to distribute Tk 10-a-kg rice for five months (March to April and September to November) a year among five million ultra-poor families.

Under the programme, the government distributed 3.88 lakh tonnes between September and November 2016.

Besides, distribution of rice through Open Market Sale (OMS) at subsidised rate also slightly decreased.

Food distribution from July 1 to December 21, 2017 through OMS was 16.17 lakh tonnes while the amount was 16.30 lakh tonnes in 2016.

Between July 1 and December 21, 2017, coarse rice's price was Tk 42 to Tk 50 while its price was below Tk 33 per kg in the same period in 2016.

Food stock also saw a rise due to the government's move of importing rice. 

From July 1, 2017 to January 2 this year, the government imported 8.31 lakh tonnes of food grain including 5.35 lakh tonnes of rice. 

In the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, the government did not import any rice. It only imported 3.92 lakh tonnes of wheat.

In the current fiscal year, the government's target is to import 20 lakh tonnes of food grains including 15 lakh tonnes of rice.

The cabinet committee on purchase has already given the approval to the food ministry for import of rice and the ministry has started the process.

#### Jan 10, 2018 : Paying a high price
Of all the reasons behind the rising cost of living in Dhaka, corruption has always been a root cause

Living costs in Dhaka have soared so high that it's not just low-income groups struggling to make ends meet—the middle class is feeling the squeeze too. According to an analysis by the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB), the cost of living in the capital hit a four-year high in 2017 due to rising prices of essentials and utilities. Onions had the highest price hike last year, followed by other vegetables, household gas, rice, liquid milk and beef. The change in the living costs in 2017 went up by an alarming 8.44 percentage points from 2016. Besides, house rent soared by 8.14 percent and electricity by 6.44 percent in 2017 from that a year ago.

We are talking about the rise in prices of all basic amenities—not luxuries that we can do without. If this trend continues, “affordable” living in Dhaka, for the majority at least, will become a fantasy.

While the cost of living for millions of Dhaka residents keeps going higher with little to no change in their income, the situation is not as bleak for many. The lucky few are government staff who, with the full implementation of the eighth national pay scale, saw their salaries go up drastically. And it is because of this that total expenditure in the first quarter of FY2016-17 was 15.5 percent higher than a year earlier. It is also because of this that there was a huge jump in non-development spending— up 19.35 percent to Tk 35,325 crore in the first quarter of FY2016-17 whereas only a year earlier non-development spending was 0.32 percent less than the year before that. The salary scale for non-government school, college and madrasa teachers also came into effect in 2017. Last year, it was also reported that the government had doubled pay for local government representatives in city corporations, municipalities, and councils for districts, upazilas and unions.

The reason I am citing these is simply because if you look at the numbers, the massive chunk of total expenditure being spent on government staff and representatives' and others' salaries simply cannot be ignored.

The debate about whether the salary increase of government staff under the eighth national pay scale is justified merits a separate article—and a lot has already been written about it in leading newspapers. But just to recap, economists have largely been in favour of the move to raise the pay of government officials because unlike in many countries, public service in Bangladesh has been less-than-rewarding in terms of pay and so, the boost in salary was seen as a way to attract meritorious candidates and tackle inefficiency in public institutions.

However, at the end of the day, this money is coming straight out of taxpayers' pockets. And whereas economic theory dictates that better wages boost efficiency, reality is far less simple. It has been observed that in developing countries like Bangladesh, good wages are not nearly enough to eradicate corruption—wealth status of a person matters little when we are talking about bribery. Now we have a situation where (i) taxpayers are paying more towards public servants' salaries, and (ii) corruption in public institutions still exists. So can we really say that we are better off? And how does this affect living costs?

The interlink between government pay raise and inflation is a whole other debate in itself—many sceptics believe pay hikes and inflation don't exactly have a causal relationship. But generally speaking, inflation is almost always one of the results of increased expenditure on government salaries.

The theory is simple. As purchasing power of a certain section of the population increases because their wages are now higher, there is more money in the market, leading to higher inflation. This of course greatly boosts traders' confidence who engage in corrupt (the magic word) practices, ultimately leading to skyrocketing prices of commodities and services.

This summary of the effects of a large portion of total expenditure being eaten away by government salaries is, of course, only part of the story. The spiralling prices of rice last year, as we saw, were attributed to a number of things—flash floods, shortage of rice in public granaries, failure to import rice on time, etc. There are a myriad of factors other than just apportioning a major pie of total expenditure to government pay raise.

All the hullabaloo surrounding gas prices last year is an example of how authorities won't even blink twice before dumping additional expenses on households, even if it means going against the law. The hike happened in two phases—first in March 2017 and then in June 2017. But thankfully, the High Court declared illegal the second phase hike on household consumers since increasing gas prices twice in the same year in a single announcement violated the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act. Mind you, the two-phase hike of 2017 came just two years after gas prices were already hiked in 2015.

The High Court decision was by all means a victory for the people and for the Consumers Association of Bangladesh (CAB) which filed the writ petition challenging the legitimacy of the decision by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission to raise gas prices. This was a rare accomplishment by CAB whose influence and strength are far from adequate compared to their counterpart in other countries where consumer rights groups wield significant power. The authority CAB can exercise is limited, which means that it cannot easily bring policy changes that would protect consumer rights.

Of all the things behind the rising cost of living in Dhaka, what remains uniquely inexcusable however is the consistent failure of the government to reduce corruption; it has seeped into every aspect of our lives—and we are quite literally paying the price for it. No sector, no industry, no stage of the supply chain seems to be immune to corruption. And as things now stand, it would be naive to be even slightly optimistic about the future of living affordability in Dhaka. For ordinary people, many of whom already live hand to mouth, the road ahead will be tougher.

#### Jan 21, 2018: Market manipulation to blame for spiralling commodity prices
[Market manipulation to blame for spiralling commodity prices]
Commodity market manipulation has vicious consequences for the economy. Photo: Star/FILE
Barrister Ali Ishtiaq

The recent price surge in kitchen commodities has created uproar in the masses. The backdrop of this bitter outrage amongst our disconcerted population was an erratic increase in the price of onions from Tk 25 to Tk 90 per kilogramme.

The overriding presumption in the present situation has signalled towards the latent employment of market manipulation methods and tactics.

Such a premise is not devoid of facts; needless to say, in recent years, the edible oil market has phased through inflated prices and rice millers have been blacklisted and fined meagrely for deceitfully stockpiling this staple food.

This hoarding effect also propels the incumbent government onto an uneasy platform, to discharge the heavy burden of satisfying the hunger of those it governs through increased spending or slashed tariffs.

As expected, market manipulation not only damages market solidarity and integrity but has vicious consequences on the economy and the government's policies and reputation at large.

Section 25(1) of the Special Power's Act 1974 gives teeth to combat this malignant misconduct, it plainly states that -- a person found guilty of the offence of hoarding can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years, life imprisonment or at the discretion of the judge, death is also a potential avenue.

Although fines are a token of legislative finesse, the gravity of these punishments alone should have been a strong deterrent. Liability for hoarding is merely attracted by- 'stocking or storing anything in excess of the maximum quantity of that thing allowed to be held in stock or storage at any one time by any person by or under any law'. 

The physical proof required for the foundation of potential charges have been difficult to satisfy due to syndicated storage schemes; albeit, not wholly impossible.

However, logistically, relative blameworthiness cannot be equal throughout the supply chain. A key factor for commodities market manipulation in this scale requires the acquisition and/or control of large resources so as to squeeze the market to create and sustain an artificially engineered price, similar to the pumping and dumping methods in stocks.

For commodities, it is highly unlikely, though not improbable, that your common marketplace wholesalers or retailers would have had such a sway over the market so as to manipulate it.

Fortunately, however, if they have abetted these traders then section 25D of the same Act reserves for them a punishment of equal scale.

For those that have become sceptical of the 'slow' hands of justice, dread not. By virtue of section 32 of the aforementioned Act, the specified offence is one that is cognizable. Under section 54 of CrPC 1898, an overwhelming power has been bestowed on the police to arrest without a warrant any person concerned and involved in any cognizable offence provided a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information is received or reasonable suspicion exists.

It cannot and must not be used as a pre-emptive detention mechanism for the purpose of preventing a prejudicial act before it has been committed. By all accounts, this often misused and abused section is potentially useful here as a veiled threat to market manipulators.

In tandem with the police authorities, it is the Bangladesh Competition Commission that was instituted following the Competition Act 2012.

The said Act was promulgated with the express view of counteracting a wider market abuse regime, namely eradicating collusion in the markets and the abuse of one's dominant position by limiting the market.

A contravention of the commission's order can result in imprisonment or a fine not exceeding Tk 1 lakh for 'each day' of non-compliance.

Nonetheless, Bangladesh still requires a conjunct legal instrument for market manipulation and insider trading so as to maintain a unified great wall against the broader and principal financial market abusers.

Quite recently in 2016, the Market Abuse Regulation (Regulation 596/2014) came into force in all member states of the European Union. It aims to codify the definitions, guidelines, prohibitions and accepted market practices with respect to insider information, insider dealing, unlawful disclosure and market manipulation under the single banner of the market abuse regulation.

Bangladesh is at a critical juncture in all respects, Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) is expected to be in the process of formalising a new commodities exchange rules following the amendments in the Securities and Exchange (Amendment) Act 2012.

Notable efforts have already been initiated to establish a working exchange—Bangladesh Jute & Commodity Exchange Ltd (BDCOMEX)—but has stagnated owing to BSEC's approval.

Although an exchange is likely to facilitate a more stable price discovery for commodities, it must be regulated carefully. For the first time in 2015, The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined and pressed charges against Arya Motazedi for front-running with non-public and confidential information, a form of insider trading, in the commodities future market for oil and gasoline.

Therefore, if and when the commodity exchange rules are formulated for a working exchange, strong emphasis on the enhanced surveillance of commodities future market, mandatory information disclosures to regulators and enforceable cash settlements should be preserved as this sector is prone to distortion and market manipulation.

#### Feb 01, 2018: No respite for the ultra-poor
Rice price still high
[No respite for the ultra-poor]

After two years, government food reserve has apparently crossed eight lakh tonnes and import of rice and wheat has surpassed 20 lakh tonnes. But despite this increase in supply, the price of rice has not gone down—much to people's dismay. According to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), in the last one month, fine rice has been selling at a retail price of Tk 54-68 per kg while coarse rice has been selling at Tk 44-46 per kg, as reported by a leading Bangla daily. The increase in overall rice price in the last one year stands at a massive 21 percent.

Experts seem to be in agreement about the fact that rice price should have been below the current retail price, given the spike in Aman rice production along with the abovementioned reasons. And the fact that it is not the case points to irregularities in the market which we believe include hoarding of rice by traders who hope to manipulate prices. While the food ministry plans to sell rice at Tk 10 per kg to 50 lakh ultra-poor people under its Food-Friendly Programme starting this March or April, there is reason for concern. Back in 2016 when this project was undertaken, allegations were rife that many influential people were receiving rice meant for people from low-income groups who are the hardest hit every time rice price increases.

Neither is rice crisis a new phenomenon for Bangladesh nor are the irregularities we see in the market. It is clear that the government needs to come up with new strategies to clamp down on hoarders whose interference in the natural market mechanism continues to worsen the plight of the poor. Furthermore, the government should ensure that rice allocated for the ultra-poor under the commendable initiatives that they have undertaken is not misappropriated.

#### 2009-10-09: Onion and garlic prices spiralling
Porimol Palma
Onion price witnessed around 50 percent hike to sell between Tk 30 and Tk 44 per kg while the price of garlic continued to show an upward trend with around eight percent increase in a month.

Importers said a fall in production of garlic in China and onion price hike in India following heavy flooding in the country's southern states recently affected the prices of these two items. Garlic price went up by around 200 percent in a year selling between Tk 70 and Tk 110 a kg.
The price of imported onion, which was between Tk 18 and Tk 25 a kg in early September, has now shot up to Tk 30 to Tk 36. This is 53.49 percent rise in a month, according to the report of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

Besides, the price of local variety of onion, which was between Tk 36 and Tk 38 per kg in early September, has now shot up to Tk 38 to Tk 44 with 10.81 percent rise, said TCB that prepared the report based on their visits to the city's Karwan Bazar, New Market, Hatirpool, Moulavi Bazar, Sutrapur, Fakirapool, Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Shahjahanpur, Malibagh, Jatrabari, Shantinagar, Kochukhet and Mohakhali markets.

Moulavi Bazar Traders Association General Secretary Golam Mawla said recent flooding in Indian southern states hampered transport of onion ultimately affecting its price in the local market.

“As onion price went up in Patna of Bihar, we now import from south Indian states. The onion price in southern states also increased because of floods,” he said.

Dhaka Metropolitan Agriculture Products Importers' Association General Secretary Khandaker Babul of Shyambazar said traders in the wholesale market of the city were badly affected, as huge amount of imported onion got rotten during the vacation of Eid and Puja.

“Traders were compelled to sell onion at negligible prices during the vacation. They are now selling onion at higher prices to make up for the losses,” he told The Daily Star yesterday.

Meanwhile, imported garlic price went up to Tk 70 to Tk 75 a kg yesterday from Tk 65 to Tk 75 a kg early September. Garlic was sold between Tk 28 and Tk 32 a kg the same time last year.

The price of local variety of garlic on October 8 last year was only Tk 30 to Tk 34 per kg, which is now between Tk 90 and Tk 110 a kg, an increase by 212.50 percent, according TCB.

“The garlic price was `$360` to `$400` per metric ton just four months back, but it has gone up to around `$1,050` now in China,” said Khandaker Babul, a garlic importer in Shyambazar.

He said they imported garlic ahead of Eid-ul Fitr at `$940` per metric ton, but it was sold at lower prices because of more supply.

“As the price in China went high, traders are afraid of importing more garlic,” Babul said, adding that this is the reason why garlic price is now high.
China witnessed around 30 percent fall in garlic production this year, according to the US-based online newspaper--The Produce News.

#### 2009-10-13: Onion import falls as India raises price
A Correspondent, Benapole

Import of onion through Benapole land port has decreased as the Indian government has raised the price of the produce because of a poor harvest and supply.Onion import through the port is gradually falling, as no new letter of credit (L/C) is being opened now, said officials.

Earlier local businessmen used to import onion from India through different land ports at a rate of `$270 per tonne. But the price has been fixed at $355` from October 6. In the last 8-9 days 1,612.72 tonnes of onion were imported through Benapole port.

Massive flood and excessive rainfall in Indian southern states have damaged onion crop and supply.

Indian commerce ministry and its affiliated body have reportedly started discouraging export of onion to Bangladesh.

Bangladeshi traders apprehend that the price would not become normal before Eid-ul Azha although Indian exporters say the situation is normal.

#### 2011-01-25: Onion: a pungent cry
Khondoker Md Shoyeb

Narayan Chandra Saha

Indian onions would only be included in salads at five-star hotel dining here if Bangladesh could meet demand for the commodity with local produce. The country would not have to sacrifice the timeless tastes of Bangladeshi cuisine because of cooking with the less-in-flavour Indian onions.
This is what Narayan Chandra Saha, an onion importer at Shyambazar in Old Dhaka, feels. He was speaking to The Daily Star on the recent hike in onion prices and its current market scenario.
The businessman pointed at the recent floods in Indian states for the hike. “The floods once again showed us how dependent we are on Indian onions.”
Local onions are better than Indian ones, and are more expensive as well. Import makes the balance, Saha said. “If there were no floods, the import of onions would not have been hampered and there would not be any price spiral.”
Nearly 80 to 100 trucks laden with Indian onions entered Bangladesh every day since the end of March through the Benapole, Bhomra, Hili and Sonamasjid land ports, he said. On the other hand, nearly 200 tonnes of local onions come to Dhaka from different districts in Bangladesh.
Local and Indian onions are usually priced at Tk 18-20 a kilogram and Tk 20-22 a kilogram this season, Saha said. “But prices of local onions went up to Tk 70 a kg in the absence of its Indian options, thanks to an export ban by the Indian agriculture ministry from December 20, 2010, after the floods.”
"The ban influenced Bangladeshi growers to harvest bulb onions even before maturity, in hopes of making some early profit, pulling the onions production down to 8 maunds from 12 maunds.”
Bangladesh is not rich in onions. The product is farmed in a few districts, like Faridpur, Rajbari, Ishwardi, Shariyatpur, Kushtia, Pabna, Madaripur, Meherpur, Chuadanga and Manikganj.
Because of the ban, local onions are now sold in the market. “We have already finished selling the onions that came from Ishwardi. We sold three fourths of the onions from Pabna. Now, onions from Faridpur are ruling the market.” “But the best onions will come from Meherpur this season after 15 to 20 days,” Saha said.
“The bulb onions were never treated as regular onions as those taste much lighter than other varieties and cannot be stored for more than 10 days.”
The storage variety of onions will appear in March and can be found in markets till December. These onions have a storage life of 8 to 10 months.
The storage onions provide 4-times better produce than bulb onions, he said. “People are selling storage onions at around Tk 1,500 a maund, almost two times more than the purchasing price of Tk 650-700 a maund last year.”
Bangladesh can hardly meet its five-month demand for onions with local produce. Moreover, business-people release the onions in stages, depending on market prices.
This season, storage onions may be priced at Tk 800-900 a maund, while a large portion will be stored, he said.
The storage onions are rain-sensitive. “There will be a huge loss if it rains in February, as growers will not get a second chance to farm the variety again this season.”
Bulb onions are usually found till mid March, while storage onion production starts at the end of March. "If there are no natural calamities in the next 2 to 3 months, onion production will be huge this time."
But Bangladesh should work for self-sufficiency in onions, Saha recommended. The government could restrict Indian onions from entering Bangladesh for at least two to three months, when local variety hits the markets, he said. “This will ensure good prices for farmers and inspire them to allocate more lands to produce the vegetable next year.”
“Our agriculture ministry should actively work to find out why all the 64 districts in Bangladesh can't produce onions. But the government should think about the consequences of what would happen if the Indian floods did not occur in the peak season of our local onions.”

#### 2011-02-11: India lifts onion export ban
Pallab Bhattacharya, New Delhi

India yesterday decided to lift a ban on onion exports after the product's prices crashed and triggered protests.
Empowered Group of Ministers on Food headed by Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee took the decision.
The Indian government had banned onion exports on December 20 last year. Onion prices had touched Rs 70-80 a kg then. India will allow shipments of onions at a minimum export price of `$600` per tonne.

#### 2011-04-27: Now bumper onion brings tears to farmers
Ahmed Humayun Kabir Topu, Pabna

Onion farmers across Bangladesh got bumper yields this year because of favourable weather conditions, but low market prices hurt them.
The crop witnessed the highest acreage this year across Bangladesh but farmers have failed to receive even the minimum price that prevailed last year. They are facing the same fate as the potato farmers do. Bumper output does not bring them any extra hope, but extra pain.
Meanwhile, farmers in Pabna have achieved remarkable success in onion cultivation, officials said. Although a majority of the onions produced in the country come from Pabna, the farmers in the district are more frustrated over poor market prices.
According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in the district, a total of 36,040 hectares of land in 9 upazilas in the district were brought under onion cultivation this year although the target was 33,100 hectares. Each hectare produced at least 10 to 10.5 tonnes of onions, while the amount was 8.5 tonnes last year, officials said.
“We fixed a target of 9 tonnes but farmers saw optimum production this year,” Md Shahin, a development officer of DAE in Pabna, told The Daily Star.
At least 3.8 lakh tonnes of onions are expected this year; it was 3.4 lakh tonnes last year. The weather was suitable and there were no natural disasters, Shahin said.
Md Eunus Ali, director of the field service wing of Agriculture Extension Directorate in Dhaka, said Pabna has been the highest onion producing district in the last few years because of its good soil quality. About 20-25 percent of the total onion produced in Bangladesh comes from this district, he said. A total of 1.7 lakh hectares in 64 districts were brought under onion cultivation, expecting over 15.3 lakh tonnes of onions this year.
“Final reports have not come in as yet as harvests are still underway in some districts. But good weather is the main reason behind bumper outputs this year, he said.
Ali said, over 15 lakh tonnes of onion would be produced in 64 districts this year although the total production was 14 lakh tonnes last year.
Of the onion producing districts, Rajshahi, Rajbari and Faridpur are also showing signs of good onion outputs, he added.
He said the farmers are mainly unhappy over the low prices.
Md Abdul Jabbar, an onion farmer in the Durgapur village of Sujanagar upazila in Pabna, said, “I spent at least Tk 13,000 to Tk 14,000 on each bigha of land to produce onions, with a target of producing over 25 to 30 maunds. But poor market prices have shattered our dreams. Even after a long struggle, I cannot make any profit.”
“My three brothers and I cultivated onions on at least 200 bighas this year, spending at least Tk 3 lakh. We got about 6,000 maunds of onion, but incurred losses for low prices. We sold onions at Tk 550 to Tk 600 a maund. At the end of the harvest season, we won't get more than Tk 3-Tk 3.25 lakh.”
Jabbar said he could get back his investment, but could not make any profit.
Marginal farmers are bearing the brunt, he added.
“We sold onions at Tk 750 to Tk 800 a maund last year. But market prices this year are dismal because of a large output.”
Many other marginal onion farmers in the district are sharing the same fate.
“I cultivated onions on a few bighas of land by taking loans from others. I spent about Tk 13,000 on each bigha. I just barely got back the production cost. The high prices last year inspired me to cultivate the crop this year.”
Jabbar said the government should take steps to control the market.
Criticising government policies, the farmers said they were deprived at a time when the crop witnessed a bumper output.
The Pabna farmers also demanded the government make arrangements so that they are able to store onions, like potatoes.
Jabbar said: “Pabna is the highest onion producing district. We did not get good prices and neither do we have any facilities to preserve the crop. So, we are bound to sell our crops to avert losses."
The government should take steps to preserve the crop so that the farmers can get the right prices at a suitable time, said the farmer.

#### 2011-09-12: Onion prices rise on Indian ban
Staff Correspondent

Prices of onions jumped yesterday, buoyed by a ban by India on the export of the item, traders said.
The price of onions rose to Tk 36-45 a kilogram yesterday from Tk 32-42 on Thursday in markets in Dhaka, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
The wholesale prices of onions also rose.
“There is a lack in the supply of onions in the market. Those who are still hoarding stocks are reluctant to sell as well,” said Idris Ahmed, owner of a wholesale store, Dhaka Baniyalaya at Shyambazar.
He said onions were selling at Tk 35-36 a kilogram at the wholesale market of Shyambazar yesterday. Prices went up since Friday afternoon, after news of the ban by India, said Ahmed.
The prices of locally produced onions also rose, influenced by the move by India, he added.
This is the second time in less than a year that India restricted onion exports to curb the hike in prices, according to Indian news reports.
On September 8, an Indian ministerial panel banned onion exports following a steep rise in prices, reports Reuters, quoting Food Minister KV Thomas. The restriction came in effect on Friday. “We will review the ban every fortnight," said Thomas.
Bangladesh meets much of its local demand for onions by importing it from the neighbouring country.
Since Saturday, 80 onion-laden trucks entered Bangladesh till yesterday afternoon, our Chapainawabganj correspondent reports.
No shipment took place at the Bhomra Land Port yesterday. The trucks carrying onions that came to the Ghojadanga Land Port on the Indian side returned without shipment, our Sathkhira correspondent reports.
Babul Hasnat Durul, an onion importer at Sona Masjid, said their suppliers are not shipping onions against the previously placed orders by Bangladeshi importers.
“We are worried. If onions are not exported against the already opened letters of credit (LCs), we will incur losses,” said Durul.
The LCs came to a halt following the ban on exports, said Islam of the C& F Agents Association.
The disruption in supply from India led to the hike in the prices of locally produced onions, said Mohammad Aminul Islam, an onion wholesaler at Karwan Bazar. He bought a 40 kilogram bag of onions from Pabna on Saturday at Tk 1,450, he said. Prices for the same stood at Tk 1,300-1,350 last week, he added.

#### 2013-02-04 Supply crunch hikes onion prices
Star Business Report

Onion prices shot up as much as Tk 9 a kilogram in the city markets due to supply disruption and escalating prices in India, the main import source.
Retailers sold onion at Tk 35-45 a kg yesterday, when a week ago it sold at Tk 28-36, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
In some stores and markets, onions are selling at Tk 50 a kg, according to data from the Department of Agricultural Marketing.
"Supply from the Bhomra land port, one of the major channels for onion import, has been on hold in the past two weeks," said Narayan Chandra Saha, an onion importer at Old Dhaka's Shyambazar, a wholesale point for onion.
The clearing and forwarding agent associations of the two countries' ports went on strike on January 20, demanding movement of heavy vehicles between the two ports.
Earlier, lorries could enter the Bhomra port, but it has been banned of late due to poor condition of the bridge.
"We hope the [strike] will be dissolved shortly and prices would come down to normal in the domestic market," said Md Alamgir Hossain, an onion importer at Bhomra.
The rising prices of onion in India, the country's main source of the essential cooking ingredient, are also to blame for the price hike.
India has seen the prices soar in recent times due to insufficient supply arising out of dry weather in its onion-producing areas.
In a letter, Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, asked Sharad Pawar, India's agriculture minister, to curb onion exports â€œto bring about an improvement in onion ratesâ€.
Helal Sikder, a salesman at Rajib Bainjavandar at Shyambazar, said prices of each kg of imported onion now stand at Tk 36 in Dhaka.
But the harvest of early varieties of onion has begun in Faridpur, one of the major onion producing areas. â€œIt will cause prices to fall,â€ he said.
Saha also expects the prices to drop in ten days' time on the back of increased arrival of imported onions and fresh harvest.

#### 2013-08-19: India taking back onion from land ports
Indians put pressure on Bangladeshi traders to hike prices
Star Business Report

India taking back onion from land ports
Indian exporters are taking back Bangladesh-bound onion from their land ports and selling them at higher prices in West Bengal, Bangladeshi importers said yesterday.
“Even yesterday large shipments of onion were waiting at Indian land ports to enter Bangladesh, but those were taken back and sold in the local [Indian] markets at higher prices,” said Khandaker Babul, general secretary of Dhaka Mohanagar Krishiponno Amdanikarok Association, a platform of perishable goods importers.
The prices of onion at the ports were settled at `$330-$350` a tonne a few weeks ago, before the Indian government set the minimum export price of the cooking ingredient at `$650` on Wednesday to tame its market.
“Now the Indian exporters are putting pressure on the Bangladeshi traders to hike the prices,” said Helal Uddin, vice-president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
They spoke at a press briefing after a meeting of the onion importers and traders with the commerce ministry at the secretariat, against the backdrop of the spiralling prices fuelled by a supply crunch in India.
Commerce Secretary Mahbub Ahmed said they are now looking into options to import onion from Myanmar through Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
“I hope the prices will come down soon,” he said.
The secretary also blamed the sudden price hike on some hoarders among farmers and traders.
The annual demand for onion is 20 lakh tonnes in Bangladesh, he said. “We have adequate stocks, but the prices went up due to a hike in the Indian market,” he said.
An additional secretary of the commerce ministry will go to Chittagong and Cox's Bazar soon to facilitate import of onion from Myanmar through Teknaf land port, Ahmed said.
The ministry's market monitoring teams will also launch drives to crack down on hoarders and price manipulators, he added.
Our Dinajpur correspondent adds: The Indian customs yesterday stopped exporting onion to Bangladesh through Hili land port without any prior notice.
Importers at the port alleged that Indian customs raised the price of onion to `$650 a tonne from $400` on Saturday.
The Indian customs officials told the Bangladeshi traders that they would not release the onion at `$400` settled in the letters of credit earlier. Before the Eid festival, the price was `$300`.
Due to the sudden decision, at least 100 onion-laden trucks got stranded inside the Indian territory, said Mazedul Haque, assistant commissioner at Hili land port.

#### 2013-09-19: Price rockets due to trading racket
Finds study
Reaz Ahmad

Price rockets due to trading racket
The steep rise in onion prices is not just the fallout of supply cut from India, but also an artificial supply shortage created by a nexus of traders, said a study by a food policy research think-tank.
“The market supply of onion in Bangladesh declined not only because of the reduction in imports from India, but also due to local traders taking advantage of the situation by cutting the supplies of their stored onions to the market in order to make extra profits,” found the study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (Ifpri).
The report was made public at a time when prices of both the homegrown and imported onions resurged after a brief respite for just a couple of weeks.
Yesterday, onion was selling at Tk85 a kilogram in Dhaka markets against the previous week's price of Tk62. The current price range is even higher than what it had been in mid-August (Tk80 a kg), according to statistics of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). A year ago, the highest price of onion was only Tk32 a kg.
Price rockets due to trading racket
Market sources said the downtrend in prices was short-lived (in between late August and early September) as some traders took full advantage of the state-run TCB's too late and too little imports from Myanmar and China.
“The prices of onion surged again because traders told us that the first consignment of government imports has already been exhausted,” said Mohammad Manik, a wholesaler of onion at Karwan Bazar.
The Ifpri study identified several factors for the sudden rise in onion prices in July-August and the subsequent short-lived downtrend and resurge in recent weeks.
Ifpri representative to Bangladesh Akhter U Ahmed feared that the “onion traders' cartel” would push the prices further up in the days leading to mid-October when the demand for the item would be at its peak with the Muslims celebrating the Eid-ul-Azha.
Talking to The Daily Star yesterday, Akhter, the lead author of the study, said the government needed to facilitate more imports from non-Indian markets and create an enabling environment at home so that more traders can get in breaking free the current oligopoly.
“Explore ways to establish an enabling environment that promotes more participation in the onion trade and guards against excessive stockpiling,” recommended the Ifpri study, Sudden onion price surge in Bangladesh: A situation analysis for policy.
Contacted, additional secretary at the commerce ministry Monoj Kumar Roy said government agencies have been on alert against onion hoarding. He could not say readily how much of a planned 5,000 tonnes emergency import has actually reached.
Monoj, however, confirmed that the fair price sale of onion (Tk47 a kg), which was launched in late August and suspended abruptly, would resume from September 22 as a last resort to tame the price resurge during the Eid-ul-Azha.
Akhter U Ahmed said the government needed to promptly mobilise a bigger volume of imports, at least 10,000 tonnes, if it wanted to offset the prospect of an even bigger surge in onion prices during the upcoming Eid season.
He also suggested the country must lessen its import-dependency in onion as it has already experienced a very encouraging growth in domestic onion production from a mere 1.5 lakh tonnes in 2001-02 to 1.16 million tonnes in 2011-12.
“A little more investment on onion can easily make Bangladesh self-sufficient and it would no longer require imports,” he mentioned adding that only four percent of the total farming community in the country now grows almost three-fourths of the current total onion requirements in less than one percent of the total arable land.
India produces around one-quarter of the global onion supply, second only to China, and historically, it has been the only source of onion imports for Bangladesh. Because of this, when recent drought in India's main onion production zones led to major crop losses, onion imports in Bangladesh decreased giving the “onion cartel” an opportunity to make windfall profit out of consumers' misery.
As the government, said Akhter, announced on August 17 its decision to import onion from Myanmar, the market price of onion began to drop. But the insignificant import volume and India's move of procuring onion from Pakistan prompted the onion cartel in Bangladesh to push up the price again, he added.
A bad weather forced India to hike its onion export price from `$250 a tonne to $650` and lately India decided to go for imports.
As onion is a key ingredient in most Bangladeshi meals, its sudden price spurt in the domestic market since early July has raised concerns in consumers and the government, noted the Ifpri study.
While the price surge hits low-income consumers the hardest, it can also become an important political issue, mentioned the report citing the example in India, where onion prices were regarded as the decisive factor in the 1998 state elections in Delhi and Rajasthan and were responsible for bringing down the central government in 1980.
Upon request from the USAID mission in Bangladesh, the Washington-based think-tank Ifpri and its Bangladesh Policy Research and Strategy Support Programme (PRSSP) team conducted the analysis.
MINISTRY WORKING ON ONION PRICES
Eighty percent work of the commerce ministry is now concentrated on onions, Commerce Minister GM Quader told parliament yesterday.
Responding to a scripted question from ruling party lawmaker Shahida Tarekh, he said, “We are discussing with the people concerned and communicating with Myanmar, China and Pakistan for importing onions.”
The higher prices of onions had made the local importers shaky and subsequently, they cut imports from India, resulting in a hike in prices after Eid-ul-Fitr, added Quader.
Queried about whether the consumers would face a similar hike in onion prices ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the minister said they were very alert now to make sure that there was no scarcity of onions at that time.

The state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) sells onions for Tk 55 per kilo from a truck in the capital's Abdul Gani Road near Bangladesh Secretariat yesterday. The move came after a sudden jump of the price by Tk 30 to Tk 105 yesterday from Tk 75 a kg on October 4 on retail markets, according to the TCB. Photo: Focus Bangla

There is no let-up in onion price hike as consumers continue to pay through their noses for this essential commodity particularly at a time when its demand is the highest during the Eid-ul-Azha.
With the latest jump in prices of onion, the government yesterday asked the deputy commissioners of all the 64 districts to monitor and report immediately any artificial jacking up of the prices.
According to a market report of the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), prices of onion soared by Tk 30 a kg within a week from Tk 75 on October 4 to Tk 105 yesterday.
The TCB said around this time last year, onion was selling at Tk 22-35 a kg.
"Local onion is available throughout the country. Besides, traders are importing it from different countries. There is no reason why the prices of onion should rise like this overnight," additional commerce secretary Monoj Kumar Roy told The Daily Star yesterday.
The district administration throughout the country has been instructed to watch out for any ulterior move to raise the prices of onion during the Eid, he said.
Official sources noted that the government has become perplexed by the erratic behaviour of traders. "It appears that everyone out in the market is trying to reap maximum benefits out of a crisis," one of them added.
Surprisingly, the latest price hike of onion took place overnight after the traders reassured the government of no more increase in its prices at a stakeholders' meeting on Thursday.
Asked about this, General Secretary of Dhaka Mohanagar Krishiponno Amdanikarok Association Khandaker Babul, said, "Imports are on although there are some problems due to a few days' halt in land port activities on the other side of the border [India] due to [Durga] Puja. But traders of locally grown onion took advantage of this and decreased the supply of onion in the hope of making more profits."
Babul said that efforts were on to enhance supply of "hoarded" onion in the market, and its prices would go down before the Eid.
In July-August, prices of onion started going up following reports that    bad weather affected production of onion in India, a main source of Bangladesh's onion import. To offset the price hike in domestic market, the TCB initially started selling onion at fair price (Tk 47 a kg) from trucks at designated places and then again at Tk 55 a kg after further price hike in the international market.
There are, however, allegations of TCB dealers not selling the fair price onion in other divisional headquarters except in Dhaka. The DCs have been also asked to monitor sale of the TCB-supplied onion.
Last month the Washington-based food policy think-tank -- International Food Policy Research Institute (Ifpri), reported that the steep rise in onion prices was not just the fallout of supply cut from India, but also an artificial supply shortage created by a nexus of traders.
“The market supply of onion in Bangladesh declined not only because of the reduction in imports from India, but also due to local traders taking advantage of the situation by cutting the supplies of their stored onions to the market in order to make extra profits,” it said.
Contacted over the phone, Ifpri representative to Bangladesh Akhter U Ahmed said the TCB should have intervened in the market in a big way to tackle the traders' nexus. Commerce ministry official Monoj Kumar Roy agreed, but added in the same breath that the TCB needed to be strengthened to go the extra miles.
Both Akhter and Monoj also said that "panic buying" by consumers also contributed to the price rise of onion.

#### 2015-05-25 (Quora) Why do onion prices in India fluctuate so often (compared to other vegetables) and how is this significant in the economy?

Since this is a broad question and the answer lies not in one single explanation, I have divided the answer in many sections, the titles to which are highlighted in bold, caps and underlined.

The sections are:
--Onion and it's significance
--Onion, it's use and its increasing demand
--Onion and its erratic supply - how seasonality affects onion prices
--Onion and its erratic supply - how government and man-made factors affect onion prices
--Onion and its erratic supply - how supply chain structure affects onion prices (including 3 sub-sections 1. statewise production share and its problems and 2. structure of the onion supply chain and 3. the example of Karnataka's Agricultural Market)
--The Solution

To get a better more complete understanding of the onion market and how pricing works, I recommend reading the entire article.

ONION AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE

Onion ranks third in the world production of major vegetables.
In India, however, it's significance is defined not only by its essential role in the diets of millions of Indians, rich and poor, but also the resulting political significance.

Onion is the only vegetable that can bring down a government from power. As history has shown, onion prices brought down the central govt. from power in 1980. Then again in 1998, the BJP lost majority in major states due to onion prices while in 2010, the Congress-led ruling government was forced to ban exports and start importing onions to prevent street protests against rising prices.

ONION AND ITS USE AND ITS INCREASING DEMAND

From North to South and East to West, it is used in many ways:

It's pureed, sautéed and added to many vegetable, dal or meat preparations


Even used to garnish in meals,


Eaten raw as a salad,


Used as a dip,


Fried as fritters and crisps.


You cannot substitute it with any other vegetable, so demand for onions is completely inelastic.

Besides, as per  NSSO data, monthly per capita consumption of onions across all of India has been increasing due to many reasons including lifestyle changes. Between years 2004-05 and 2009-10, the consumption of onions increased 32% and 18% in rural and urban India respectively while production of onions in India between these two years increased almost 90%.


 Additionally, there is also a lot of demand of Indian Onion in the world. Onion is mainly exported from India in the form of dehydrated onion, canned onion and onion pickle. Dehydrated onions are considered as a potential product in world trade and India is the second largest producer of dehydrated onions in the world.

So, unlike regular food grains, onion is also being cultivated in many regions of India mainly for commercial purpose, not for home consumption (subsistence) purpose only. This explains why government in the recent years has tried to restrict export of onions from time to time to sustain domestic demand. Whether this move is helpful in regulating prices in the long run is a separate topic for debate discussed later.

So, I think it is safe to say that with onions, increasing high inelastic demand is a big factor yet it cannot be the only reason why market prices of onions is so volatile.

ONION AND IT'S ERRATIC SUPPLY - HOW SEASONALITY AFFECTS ONION PRICES

Onion is a cool season crop. It is grown during winter and harvested before the real hot season begins.

In India, onion is grown in three crop seasons: Rabi (Summer Crop), Kharif (Early Winter Crop) & (Late Winter Crop) and the harvest times of each crop are as follows:



During the period between June and September (Monsoon season in India), no onions are harvested (but kharif seeds are sown during this period) and demand is sustained by the summer (rabi) crop, which is harvested in March and April, is stored and supplied to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif (early winter) crop by mid-September onwards.

The summer (rabi) crop comprises approximately 60% of the total production of onions in India and has a shelf life of around 6-7 months only. Mainly, the Rabi onion may be stored till October-November and is made available steadily for domestic as well as export markets.

So, as per general seasonal trend, price of onion tend to increase and reach at peak during September to November and drops in January-March with the arrival of the late kharif crop.

And  mostly when the winter (kharif) crop harvest is poor, the onion supply goes down and prices spike during winters. It has been observed that the main Kharif yields' dependency on rains disturbs the regular production and amounts to heavy losses of the produce as well as of farmer’s incomes.

ONION AND IT'S ERRATIC SUPPLY - HOW GOVERNMENT AND MAN-MADE ACTIONS AFFECT ONION PRICES

Sometimes, price rise (retail price rise in particular) may also be due to delayed arrival of onions in the market, delays may be due to natural causes or man-made caused by activities like hoarding, supply chain mismanagement and government actions plus also due to general inflation of fuel prices.

The government controls the prices of Onions through various measures like setting 'Minimum Export Price' (MEP) and including onions in the 'Essential Commodities Act' while reducing stock holding limits.

For example recently in the year 2014, on March 3, the central government had removed MEP of onions due to rise in kharif production. But, unseasonal rainfall and hailstorm had hit the Nashik (Maharashtra) district in March that badly affected the quality of summer onions. As a result, the arrival of good quality onions in the market was up to 10%, while the remaining 90% was of poor and medium quality. After the domestic prices rose due to scarcity of onions, the government again introduced MEP of $300 per tonne on June 17 and increased it to $500 a tonne on July 2 to control the prices in the domestic market. After pressure from farmers, who were forced to sell their produce below cost, the central government reduced the MEP to $300 a tonne on August 21.

It may be noted that Maharashtrais the biggest producer of Onions in India and Lasalgaon (town in Nashik District in Maharashtra) is the largest hub of onions in Asia. Nashik district also contributes 80% of the total onion export of the country. The central government policies for stabilizing onion prices intra-country led to a decline in exports but the price consumers had to pay was inconsistent across various states due to other logistic issues.

ONION AND IT'S ERRATIC SUPPLY - HOW THE SUPPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE AFFECTS PRICES

One important thing to note in the case of perishable items like onions is that, the most important fall-out of a weak monsoon is not truly reduced food supplies and higher food prices, but rather the expectations and fears that weaker rains will likely cause. Unfortunately, market expectations often tend to be self-fulfilling.

And these market expectations of traders matter because about 97% of the country’s onion harvest is sold in 50 major onion market yards, regulated under the APMC Act.

Each state has its own version of the model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act (APMC Act). This determines the market structure—who can buy and sell to whom, where, when and the charges and taxes to be paid at each stage.

The government's swift action with a slew of measures to try to stave off market overreactions, such as setting minimum export prices, using public distribution systems to distribute high-priced food items, and coaxing states to respond firmly to hoarders has often helped the onion sector but the big discussion remains that government interference only helps cure the symptoms of the problems prevalent in the system and not the problem itself.

To better understand these problems, one has to understand:

STATEWISE PRODUCTION SHARE AND ITS PROBLEMS

Per 2014-15 production figures, major onion producing states in India are Maharashtra(30.29%), Karnataka (10.98%), Madhya Pradesh (15.33%), Andhra Pradesh (3.44%), Bihar (6.74%), Gujarat (9.56%), Rajasthan (3.07%), Haryana (4.33%), Tamil Nadu (2.69), Uttar Pradesh (2.14) & Odisha, Telengana & West Bengal (2% each) which together account for a little over 90 percent of total production.


Three major producers of Onions in India Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh together hold 60% of the area under onion cultivation and contribute to over 55% of the onion production in the country. Per 2011 census, these three states support at least 20% of the population.

In Maharashtra for example (estimate based on 2004-05 NSSO data), the states' own consumption was roughly 24% of its production while 40% of its production was exported and 2% processedand the remaining was wastage. Per some data, Maharashtra is also supplying onions to other Indian states including the north and east of the country but specific figures are unavailable.

If we study the production growth patterns of these three states, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have both increased production in the last few years while production growth in Karnataka has been inconsistent.


Maharashtra is the top producer of Onions and its production has increased over the years, however, erratic weather, volatile market price, lack of adequate storage and market infrastructure have caused instability in production through preventing the farmers in taking the optimal decision on allocation of area and raising of farm productivity.

Although, productivity of onion has improved from last decade, still onion production is mainly driven by acreage allocation. As onion is irrigated crop and Maharashtra is endowed with relatively less irrigation potential, increasing production through scaling up area for onions may not have been possible without reducing the acreage under other important high value crops. So, it is advantageous for the producers and supply chain managers to sell onions at a higher market price.

To better understand who benefits from the higher price of onions let us understand the structure of the supply chain.

STRUCTURE OF THE ONION SUPPLY CHAIN

6 of the top ten onion markets are in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have 1 each. So, more than half of India’s daily arrivals pass through these 10 markets.

Typically, thousands of small farmers bring their produce to a small number of licensed commission agents, traders and exporters at their nearest market. Here, quantity is what counts, not quality. When a large number of farmers are trying to sell to a small number of licensed buyers, they have little bargaining power. They have no access to price information in other markets or about the pipeline of arrivals into the same market.

Per some estimates farmers receive at best 45 paisa from every rupee spent by the consumer. Rest is pocketed by traders, CAs, transporters and retailers.

The traders and commission agents in every onion mandi (market) are an old boys’ club, where membership is hereditary and controlled by an intricate system of marriages and alliances. Collusion and price fixing are rampant but no one will expose his brother.

Onions bought from these wholesale traders/commission agents flow into grocery stores to serve over a billion consumers. There are also no laws to prevent retailers from charging what they please.

The case of Maharashtra as reported in the 2014 NDTV report Maharashtra: How Political Ambitions Fuel Rising Onion Pricesclearly explains the flaws of the current Agricultural Market System.

The case of Delhi, as reported in With or without APMC delisting, its business as usual for traders, where fruits and vegetables were delisted from the APMC act also did not provide any long term solution to the problems of onion prices.

THE EXAMPLE OF KARNATAKA'S AGRICULTURAL MARKET.

In 2013, the Karnataka government also tried to remedy this situation by introducing large-scale agricultural marketing reforms through a new law that requires just one license to operate in all of its 500 regulated market yards. It also expanded the definition of a market yard so that even a warehouse can be treated as a market yard and farmers can sell at a warehouse near their farm and companies can also set up private market yards.

The idea behind this move is that more traders means more competition and better prices to farmers.

What is interesting to note here is that while the Karnataka's government focused it's efforts on reforming the agricultural market sector, its production declined drastically which is yet to be explained.

Onion production in Karnataka was estimated at 25.23 lakh tonnes in 2012-13 against 24.51 lakh tonnes in the previous year, however, production for the year 2012-13 was only 23.95 lakh tons, while 2013-14, the production dropped further to 20.65 lakh tons. Even though the dropping trend was reversed during 2014-15 by producing 21.25 lakh tons, not only the state has lost its position as the second highest producer of onions, the production of onions is 13.3% lower than the production of 2011-12 while the area under onion cultivation has reduced by 20.7% as compared to 2011-12.

Going back to Karnataka's agricultural marketing reforms, Karnataka also introduced an electronic market place that ensures that the quality and quantity of every bag of produce is entered into an online system as a farmer arrives at a mandi. Traders bid for each lot online (even by sms) and everyone can see the prices being offered.

Two major onion markets in the state, Gadag and Hubli, have adopted the system and the plan is to eventually link all the large market yards in Karnataka into one unified market with seamless price discovery, price dissemination and freedom to enter and exit.

However, per Oct 2014 news reports, the city of Bangalore which consumes around 300 tons of onions a day, receives nearly 10,000 tons a day from the North of Karnataka. While prices in the city reign between 2,500 to 3,500 per quintal, 200kms away in Central Karnataka (where 'Gadag' is one of the markets), farmers dump their onion produce in the market at 100-150 per quintal.

Most of this stock received in Bangalore is said to be supplied to other states including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and as far away as West Bengal. Some of it is said to even enter Bangladesh, the best quality onions picked up by exporters.

So, the move meant to bring in more transparency did not necessarily bring more efficiency into the system as prices were still dictated by traders.
Sometimes, what happens in Karnataka is that, Maharashtra traders often buy up onions in Karnataka markets when they sense a shortage.

One of the reasons attributed to the falling price is excessive rain this monsoon that has affected the quality of the yield and the merchants are not ready to pay more for the “wet” yield. Although the farmers admitted that their crop had been affected, they were of the opinion that “poor quality” was a mere ploy by merchants and brokers to reduce the price.

Historically if you see, Onion yield arriving at the APMC at Amaragol during August 2013, fetched Rs. 4,350 a quintal at higher end due to apprehension that there might be shortfall of supply in Nasik market due to poor monsoons.

One year later, the price at higher end is now Rs. 1,900 a quintal. Some say this is because of huge but poor quality arrivals in the market while some traders also explain that many farmers opted for onion cultivation hoping that they would get better price. Meanwhile, amid concerns about high prices, the government relaxed the norms for import of onion. And now due to huge arrivals and the relaxed import norms there is a slump in the price.

A point to note here is that since each state is like a kingdom when it comes to agriculture, the benefits of any state reforms will always be limited not only by State boundaries and the Central policy that rules the All India Market for Onions but also due to the demand and supply mechanics prevalent in other states.

THE SOLUTION

Some experts believe that the solution to most of India's problems (like the onion problem) lies in a law that unites our 29 states into single agricultural market.

A case in example for benchmark would be that of the European Union, which created a single agricultural market with 29 countries.

The EU adopted a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) as part of the Treaty on European Union and this 'CAP' seeks to increase agricultural productivity, ensure livable wages for agricultural workers, stabilize agricultural markets, and assure availability of affordable produce throughout the EU.

Going back in history, when the Treaty of Rome established the common market in 1958, State intervention was a major feature of agriculture in the six founding Member States. If the principle of the free movement of goods was to apply to agricultural produce, ongoing State intervention notwithstanding, national intervention mechanisms which were incompatible with the common market had to be transferred to Community level; this is the basic rationale behind the establishment of the CAP.

The objectives of the CAP are both economic and social and are intended to safeguard the interests of producers and consumers.

Although the CAP has reduced conflicts within the EU, it has to some extent  led to the overproduction of certain commodities, including butter, wine, and sugar which has caused disagreements between the EU and some agricultural exporting nations (including the United States and Australia).
Nevertheless, the EU continues to develop and enhance its Agricultural sector  and the CAP has evolved significantly since it was created by the Treaty of Rome (1957). Substantial reforms over the years have moved the CAP away from a production-oriented policy.

#### 2017-04-04 Low onion prices depress growers
    A good domestic harvest and an upsurge in imports have led to the drop in onion prices, much to the dismay of many growers who are now staring at losses.
    In growing areas, the prices of the most popular variety of locally grown onion have plunged to Tk 600 a maund (40 kilograms) from Tk 800-Tk 900 last year, according to traders. And it is the same story for the other varieties of onion.
    “This year's prices appear to be one of the lowest in years,” said Md Safar Ali Biswas, an onion grower at Chowgachhi village of Magura, one of the onion growing districts.
    For Biswas and many others in the southwest and northwest districts of Magura, Rajbari, Faridpur and Pabna, cultivating onion, an essential cooking ingredient, is one of the main sources of income.
    “At the going prices it will not be possible to bear our cost of living,” said Biswas, who has grown onion on one acre this season.
    He has to invest about Tk 13,000 to grow onion on 28 decimals of land, from where he can get 20-28 maunds of the vegetable. The sum does not include the cost of labour.
    “Growers here cultivate onion and garlic as cash crops, so the price fall has squeezed their income,” said Gobinda Saha, an onion trader in Rajbari district.
    The ample supply of onion amid a good local harvest and increased imports has brought down the prices, traders and farmers said.
    Onion imports soared 54 percent year-on-year to 7.14 lakh tonnes in the first half of fiscal 2016-17, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. “We suffer from low prices whenever imported farm produce floods the market,” said Abdul Hai, a small farmer in Pabna.
    Domestically, onion acreage and production have been on the rise since fiscal 2013-14 because of growers' renewed interest. In fiscal 2015-16, Bangladesh's onion production grew 2 percent year-on-year to 17.35 lakh tonnes. It was grown on 1.77 lakh hectares that year, according to BBS.
    Farmers planted onion on 2.10 lakh hectares this fiscal year, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension's estimates.
    Neighbouring India, a big source of the key cooking ingredient for Bangladesh, saw higher production this year.
    As a result, the prices in Bangladesh have remained low for the last several months, said Ratan Kumar Saha, an onion importer. Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market, expects the onion prices to remain low for the next couple of months.
    In Dhaka, the retail prices of locally grown onion stood at Tk 20-26 per kilogram yesterday, down from Tk 25-35 a year ago. The prices of imported onion were also below last year's level, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. To protect farmers, Mohammad Kamruzzaman, an onion trader in Sachilapur, Magura, urged the government to discourage imports during the harvesting period.

#### 2017-04-19  Onion prices on the rise again
    Onion prices are seeing a sprial as stockists have become active in buying the vegetable from growers to sell during the off season, said traders yesterday.

    The prices of the locally grown finest quality onion bulb have shot up to Tk 25 a kilogram from Tk 20 per kg two-three weeks ago in the growing districts.

    The vegetable traded between Tk 22-Tk 23 each kilogram at haats, up from Tk 15-Tk 17 two-three weeks ago, according to onion wholesalers. In Dhaka, retailers were selling onion, a key cooking ingredient, for as high as Tk 35 per kilogram yesterday, in contrast to Tk 28 a week ago.

    “The prices have gone up within a short time,” said Narayan Saha, proprietor of Nobin Traders, an onion wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital.

    The spike was influenced by the stockists' purchasing spree, he said.

    Traditionally, large farmers and a section of people at growing regions invest in freshly harvested onions so that they can profit from selling bulbs at higher prices during the off-season.

    “This practice has been going on for decades. I have been witnessing this business since my childhood,” said Gobinda Saha, a trader and stockist at Rajbari, one of the major growing districts.

    The supply has reduced because of increased stocking, he said. A large portion of onions have already gone towards stocking, said Md Aminul Islam, a wholesaler at Sathia, another growing district in northwest Pabna. “Stockists sometimes offer higher prices than us to grab onions,” he said.

    The excessive rainfall during the harvesting period has affected crops in the locality, according to Islam.

    “A large portion of the onions have become rotten as a result of the hailstorm. This is another reason for the spiral in prices,” he said. Farmers planted onion on 2.10 lakh hectares this fiscal year, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension's estimates. Influenced by the increased prices of locally grown onion and sluggish import early this month, the prices of imported bulbs also increased, Narayan said.

    In Dhaka, imported onions sold at Tk 22-Tk 26 each kg yesterday from Tk 20-Tk 22 a week ago.

    The locally grown ones sold at Tk 28-Tk 32 per kg at the retail level yesterday from Tk 24-Tk 28 a week ago, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. However, the prices are still lower than a year ago, TCB data showed.

    Bangladesh consumes 20 lakh tonnes of onion a year but it has to rely on imports due to inadequate production. Onion acreage and production have been on the rise since 2013-14 because of growers' renewed interest. But yields still are not enough to meet the demand.

    Onion production grew 2 percent year-on-year to 17.35 lakh tonnes in fiscal 2016. It was grown on 1.77 lakh hectares that year, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

#### 2017-07-13 (NDTV): Here We Go Again: Onion Prices Rise Due to Tight Supply
Onion prices at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra, Asia's biggest wholesale market for the staple, have started rising again due to supply concerns as the old stock has been exhausted, while the fresh kharif crop this year is expected to be 25-30 per cent lower.

Onion price, which had touched the record Rs 57 per kg in August at Lasalgoan, showed a declining trend after the Centre took several steps including hike in minimum export price and imports to boost domestic supply. It fell as low as Rs 25 per kg on October 16 at Lasalgaon.

However, prices started rising again beyond Rs 30 per kg in the last one week and are now ruling at Rs 32 per kg at Lasalgaon, as per the data maintained by the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF). A similar upward trend in wholesale onion prices was seen in Delhi and other mandis.


"This is a normal trend. The average wholesale onion price is ruling around Rs 30 per kg. At times, prices go up when arrivals are less, but rates come down as arrivals rise. We are keeping a close watch on rates," Nasik-based NHRDF Director R P Gupta told PTI.


He also said "there is no cause of worry" as more arrivals of fresh kharif crops are expected in the coming days from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Asked if there would be fall in 2015 kharif onion ouptut this year, Gupta said: "Overall kharif output would be same at last year's level. Although onion production in Maharashtra is expected to be lower due to poor rains, but that loss will be compensated in other states."


Meanwhile, farm experts and traders are projecting 25-30 per cent fall in this year's kharif output due to drought situation in the country's top two onion growing states -- Maharashtra and Karnataka. They also warned further spike in onion prices in the coming days as about 4 million tonnes of old stock has been sold off completely and new kharif crop is seen lower.


That apart, farmers are hesitant of getting fresh produce to mandis in the wake of extreme price volatility. They are waiting for correct price signal, they added. Onion production was 18.73 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June). Kharif onion output contributes 20 per cent to the overall production.


#### 2017-08-04: Onion dearer upon price hike in India - Daily Star
    Onion prices are soaring in the domestic market on the back of higher prices in India, the main source of supply of the essential cooking ingredient.
    Yesterday, people in Dhaka city had to foot as much as Tk 45 for a kilogram of onion, which they could get at Tk 40 a week ago, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
    Overall, the prices rose 39 percent to Tk 30-Tk 45 each kilogram yesterday from Tk 22-Tk 32 a month ago.
    “The market has been stable over the past several months. Suddenly, it became unstable because of a price spiral in India,” said Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market, one of the main depots of onion in the capital.
    The wholesale prices of Indian onion that were Tk 24-Tk 25 per kilogram on August 2 shot up to Tk 30 per kilogram yesterday, he said.
    Although Bangladesh annually produces more than 17 lakh tonnes of onion, it has to import a good amount to fully meet domestic requirements.
    In the first 11 months of last fiscal year, 14.13 lakh tonnes of onion were imported, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.
    Currently, onions are mainly imported from Nashik, a city in the northwest region of Indian state Maharashtra that is famous for its fresh agricultural produce.
    “Rainfall is to blame for the recent price hike,” said Md Asadul Islam, an importer at Bhomra Land Port that mainly handles onion imports, adding that the prices might go up further.
    Some Indian media outlets report that the prices of onion have risen in the neighbouring country over the last two weeks.
    The bullish sentiment in onion is backed by three factors: procurement by Madhya Pradesh government, heavy rainfall in Gujarat and expectations of a lower and delayed crop in Karnataka, reported The Economic Times yesterday.
    India had seen a bumper crop of onion in 2016, which led to prices tumbling below production costs. Farmers protested, forcing the Madhya Pradesh government to procure onions at Rs 8kg.
    Heavy rainfall in Gujarat reduced onion movement in the state.
    “We have good domestic production this year, but fluctuation in the prices of onion in the neighbouring country is influencing prices here” said Ratan Saha, who follows agri-commodity market, particularly onion and garlic.
    “This is because of our dependence on India for onion,” he said, adding that imports from Pakistan, Myanmar and China may rise for the soaring prices.

#### 2017-08-04 (IndianExperss): After tomato, surge in onion price likely

After tomatoes, it is onions that are threatening to turn the tide of low – actually negative — food inflation. On Thursday, the bulb was trading in Maharashtra’s Lasalgaon wholesale market at an average price of Rs 23 per kg. This was as against Rs 12.70 per kg just a day before which also saw the Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark repo lending rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6 per cent. Like in the case of tomatoes, the spike in onion prices has been sudden.

Since February 2016, onions were selling in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10 per kg, averaging as low as Rs 4.50-5.50 only this May-June. The modal or most-quoted rate at the country’s largest market for the bulb was Rs 5.70 per kg even as late as July 17. On July 26, it crossed Rs 10 and has more than doubled since then.

The interesting part about the price spiral is that it has come despite Lasalgaon recording about 22,000 quintals of onion arrivals on Thursday, compared to 13,000 quintals in the preceding two days. Also, this happens to be the month of Shravan in the Hindu calendar when onion consumption is supposed to be low. The bulb was, in fact, quoting in the Delhi market at an average of only Rs 13.75 per kg today although official arrivals there were just 14,263 quintals.

Omprakash Ratanlal Raka, a Lasalgaon-based onion trader and exporter attributed the firming up of prices to drought in Karnataka which has reported 26 per cent deficient rainfall so far in the current monsoon season. “The fresh kharif crop from Karnataka normally starts arriving towards mid-August and peaks by the first week of September. This time, there are reports of a 50 per cent dip in onion acreage in the state and that is what is driving prices”, he said. In Bengaluru, too, onion prices rose from Rs 15.80 to Rs 20.20 per kg today.

“The sudden price jump is only a result of demand and supply factors. Traders expect that the demand for onions from North India will pick up once the Shravan month gets over after Raksha Bandhan which is August 7. On the other hand, with the drought in Karnataka, there isn’t going to be any immediate source of supply till about mid-September”, said Nanasaheb Patil, director of the agriculture produce market committee at Lasalgaon.
The wholesale onion prices at Vashi Agricultural Produce Market Committee(APMC) are down by 1200 rupees a quintal since Tuesday. The reason: a glut of fresh stock that’s flooded the market from China, Pakistan and Egypt. A spike in fresh supply from Karnataka has also contributed to the fall in the wholesale rates.

Karnataka produces around 2.7 million tonnes (mt) out of India’s total annual onion output of 20-21 mt, making it the third largest after Maharashtra (6.5 mt) and Madhya Pradesh (2.8 mt). Onions are grown mostly during the kharif season with sowing in June-August following the monsoon rains. This crop arrives first in Karnataka from mid-August and in Maharashtra after mid-September.

In Maharashtra, farmers also plant a late-kharif crop during September-October, which is harvested in December-January, and rabi onion that is sown in November-December and harvested over March-April. The rabi crop, which is also grown in parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, is amenable to storage. Maharashtra farmers store this crop in structures called “kanda chawl” to prevent moisture causing the bulbs to sprout or rot. The stored onions are what feed the markets right until end-August when the fresh Karnataka crop would have arrived.

Traders estimate that Maharashtra farmers would have stored some 1.8 mt of onions from the last rabi crop which they sell in a staggered way. The corresponding figures for MP and Gujarat are in about 1.2 mt and 0.4 mt respectively. “This time, most of them made heavy losses on the stored onions, as prices ruled rock-bottom. In MP, the state government was actually forced to buy over 0.8 mt at Rs 8/kg. The farmers who hadn’t yet sold are obviously making money now”, a trader pointed out.

The high prices should induce farmers to sow more area in the ongoing kharif season. Till date, Maharashtra has reported only around 10,000 hectares of onion planting, as against the normal 30,000 hectares during kharif. Sowing has been lower partly because of the main Nashik belt receiving torrential rains during July and also un-remunerative prices. That could change in the coming weeks, with both prices and the weather looking up.

“We hope the Centre will not take steps like export ban and imposing stockholding limits, as in 2014 and 2015. High domestic prices will automatically put a brake on exports. Moreover, should not the farmer be entitled to some price increase after almost one-and-a-half years of losses?” asked Patil. India, in 2016-17, shipped out 2.42 mt on onions valued at Rs 3,106.50 crore. During the previous financial year, these amounted to 1.38 mt and Rs 3,097.21 crore, respectively.

    Some people decided to give their votes to BJP and accept their slavery. They forgot too much power to one party will lead to the dictatorship and will make the any party or government arrogant will harass normal people with their ordinance and misuse of law. Keep our voting power and have a Congress as a strong opposition so they can represent us at least as an opposition. Dont forget democracy is by the people, for the people and to the people.

    Every year there has been problems on the prices of various vegetables specifically Onions as well tomato and may be more and the varion on prices leads to the problems of the house -wives. For every problem there exist a solution and we must work out on for solutions- Just few days earlier tomatoes were thrown on the road on the other the Farmers were deprived of even cost of cultivation,on the other for want of storage huge quan ies of onions were wasted or spoiled due to massive rains and definitely for want of storage facilities in addition important factor- Is our farmer getting the right returns for both tomatoes as well onions- the need of the hour is to improve on system- proper warehousing, allowing farmers to opt for marketing their product in the market may be through co-operative societies or formation of groups of farmers to opt for access of their product to the market. We must understand that most of the price variation is through middle man-what our farmer getting.

    India can deal with dual menace of onions and tomato crisis by a dual action plan. This should involve education and increasing capacity of processing industry. EDUCATION about onions- onion is mainly used for making dishes tastier. It is low in many vitamins, and one can actually live without it. Therfore, INDUSTRIAL processing of onions to make a ready made 'tarka mix', would not only boost profit but also produce a long lasting shelf-item capable of saving fuel cost. .....Tomatoes are a different item. A significant nutritive value lies in its raw consumption, rather than cooking. EDUCATION..People should eat it raw or make a fresh puree to be added last on top of food on plate. Frying or making taka from tomatoes destroys all of the vitamin C. Tomatoes have a small shelf life, but highly amenable to processing such as making tomato sauces popular all over India. Mexican salsa should be popularized for maximizing nutrition from the fresh (and expensive) onions and tomatoes.

        The menace of onion prices can be mitigated to a big extent by popularizing home growing of evergreen onions, which can keep producing onion greens for many years (5-10 years is not uncommon) with very little water requirements. Dried vegetable waste could be used as fertilizer. A shallow planter with a larger surface area in a semi shaded area may contain several dozen plants. One should only harvest the top green leaves, and leave couple of inches at the bottom.

#### 2017-10-12: Onion price shoots up
Supply short for land port closure, says importers’ leader
[Onion price shoots up]

Our Correspondent, Dinajpur

The price of onions shot up by Tk 8 to Tk 10 per kilogram in the retail and wholesale markets in the northern districts due to supply shortfall as the land ports were closed for Durga Puja and Ashura.

According to the land port authorities, import and export through land ports across the country remained closed for seven to 10 days for Durga Puja and Ashura. The ports reopened on October 3, they said.

As there was no import, onion price started soaring in the markets. Imported onion is being sold at Tk 40 per kg in the wholesale markets, whereas it was Tk 30 per kg two weeks ago. In the retail markets, the price is Tk 44 to Tk 45 per kg, traders said.

The price of locally produced onion has remained unchanged. It costs Tk 52 per kg in the retail markets, while it is Tk 48 per kg in the wholesale markets, they said.

Altaf Hossain, an onion trader of Bahadurbazar in the town, said he bought Indian onion from the importers at Hili land port in Hakimpur upazila of the district.

“I purchased onion at Tk 36 per kg from the importers,” he said, adding that there is no sign of price fall although trading through the land port resumed on October 3.

According to the customs department in Hili land port, around 1,500 tonnes of onion were imported through the port in the last seven days. Importers brought around 13,000 tonnes of onion from India in September and 16,000 tonnes in August through the port, said Protap Mallik, an official of Hili land port.

Harun Ur Rashid, president of Importers' Group of Hili Land Port, said onion price went up as there was no trade during the Durga Puja festival and Ashura.

Prices will come down in a couple of weeks as trading resumed around a week ago, he added.

#### 2017-10-29: Onion prices soaring - Daily Star
    Onion prices were nearly one and a half times that of a week ago, and local traders are blaming the hike on increased prices in India, the country's main source of import.

    Local variety was sold at as much as Tk 90 each kilogram in some kitchen markets of the capital yesterday, to the annoyance of people already hit hard by hiked rice price. Imported onions were sold at Tk 70 a kg.
    A week ago, prices of the vegetable were in the range of Tk 48 to Tk 60 per kilogram, according to the data of Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.
    The onion prices have gone up in Chittagong as well, reports our correspondent.

    “When will the price hit the Tk 100 level,” an annoyed shopper asked a seller after being told the price of locally-grown onion was Tk 80 a kg at the AGB Colony kitchen market in Dhaka.

    Refusing to give her name, she said she was aware of the recent price rise, but still was not expecting the onion price to be so high.
    Traders blamed the price hike on high cost of import from India, the main source of onion, due to crop loss in heavy rains in the neighbouring country. The cultivation of early varieties of onion here was also affected by downpour at a time when old stocks were depleted.

    Mosharaff Hossain, a trader of the kitchen market, said he had bought local and Indian onions at Tk 75 and Tk 54 a kg from Shyambazar wholesale market the day before.

    “Today I came to know that local onions are being sold at Tk 80-82 per kilogram at wholesale. I am yet to increase the prices because my purchase prices were lower,” he said yesterday.

    Onion is the latest item taking away a larger slice of the budget for grocery items, particularly of low income families who have already been experiencing squeezing of  their purchasing capacity for high prices of rice and vegetables. Very few vegetable items are now available in the markets at below Tk 50 per kilogram.

    “My income is not increasing, but prices of daily essentials are going up every day. We cannot afford the living cost,” said Md Faruk, a cobbler at Jamal Khan of Chittagong.

    Asadul Islam, an onion importer at Bhomra Land Customs Station, said the recent rainfall had damaged crops that were supposed to be harvested now in Nashik, one of India's main onion producing regions.

    “Growers there are selling onions from their stocks,” he said, adding that import costs, including transport and other expenses, amounted to Tk 50 per kilogram at Bhomra.

    Asked about the chances of traders hoarding the food item, he said onion is a perishable commodity and one could stock imported onions only for one or two days.

    Onion prices in the local markets largely depend on the prices in India, as Bangladesh does not produce enough to meet its annual requirement. Domestic production has risen in recent years though.

    Between July and August, two lakh tonnes of onion have been imported. The total import in fiscal 2016-17 was 15.01 lakh tonnes, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market, said prices were high in India, and the stock of locally-grown onion had almost been exhausted.

    Azizul Haque, a wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, said heavy rains had affected cultivation of early varieties of onion in the main producing districts such as Pabna. “Farmers are re-growing onions now after suffering from losses.”

    Mohammad Idris, proprietor of M/S Bacha Miah Saodagor, a wholesale shop at Khatunganj wholesale market, Chittagong, said onion prices had gone up in the local market due to increasing import costs.

    The price of Indian onion has increased by Tk 3 a kg since Friday last, he said, adding, “As Indian onion shares almost 80 percent of the local market, the prices of onion here are determined by ups and downs of that.”

    However, regulation of the retail market is necessary. The government should monitor the retail market           so that retailers cannot hike the prices illogically, Md Afsar Uddin, proprietor of Sonali Traders at Khatunganj wholesale market, Chittagong, said.

#### 2017-11-10: Prices of Indian onion drop in Ctg
[Prices of Indian onion drop in Ctg]
Dwaipayan Barua

For the first time in three weeks, Indian onion prices saw a downtrend at the Khatunganj wholesale hub in Chittagong in the last two days.

Prices of older stocks imported from India's Nasik region dropped by Tk 6-8 to Tk 42-45 per kilogramme (kg) as traders attempted to sell those off at the close of the season before those went bad.

Prices of recently harvested imports that have started to arrive also fell by around Tk 7 to sell at Tk 50 per kg.

However, the changes were yet to reach kitchen markets where the older varieties were selling at Tk 60 to Tk 65.

The local variety still remains pricey at around Tk 70 in wholesale and Tk 80-85 in kitchen markets, resulting in poor demand.

Demand for the older variety decreased noticeably in the last two weeks mainly for its high price and this could be the reason for the price fall, said Mohammad Faruq, director of wholesaler Era Traders.

The stocks were old and would not last long, he said, adding that new imports have started to arrive on a small scale.

Anwar Hossain, proprietor of Dhaka Traders, said they usually sold a truckload every day but sales had halved in the last two weeks. He thinks traders might have opted for lesser profits to avoid losses.

On prices still remaining high in kitchen markets, a staffer at Sarkar Traders at Karnaphuli CDA Market said they bought the stocks last week at a higher price and so they were charging accordingly.

He acknowledged that sales had decreased for this.

Sagir Ahmed of Bagdadi Corporation at Khatunganj hoped for further drops in wholesale prices within a few days which would eventually bring down retail prices.  

#### 2017-11-23 (NDTV): Government Imposes `$850` Per Tonne Minimum Export Price On Onion To Boost Local Supplies

New Delhi: The government on Thursday imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of `$850` per tonne on onion to increase domestic supplies and check rising prices. MEP is the minimum rate below which exports are not allowed. Onion MEP was scrapped in December 2015. In a notification, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said: "Export of onion...shall be permitted only on Letter of Credit (LC) subject to a MEP of USD 850 per tonne till December 31, 2017."

Export of all varieties of onions will be allowed only on LC, it added. Concerned over the rise in onion prices, Consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan in August had sought that MEP be imposed on its exports by the commerce ministry. He also sought the removal of sops on export of the kitchen staple.

Retail onion prices, which have shot up to Rs. 50-65 per kg in most cities, have come under pressure due to tight domestic supplies. The government has asked state-run MMTC to import 2,000 tonnes of onion, while other agencies Nafed and SFAC to buy onions locally and supply in consuming areas. Supplies got exhausted as large quantity of exports were undertaken in the first four months of the current fiscal. The country exported 1.2 million tonnes in April-July of this fiscal, up by 56 per cent from the year-ago period. Also, the new 2017-18 kharif crop -- which is being harvested -- is expected to be less owing to fall in acreage.

Recently, a senior consumer affairs ministry official had said that the new kharif crop is likely to be lower by 10 per cent as area sown is 30 per cent lower. About 40 per cent of the country's total onion crop is produced in the kharif season, and the rest during the rabi season. The kharif crop, however, cannot be stored. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat are the major onion producing states.


#### 2017-12-01 (Scroll.in): Onion price rise spreads to other Asian countries as key exporter India tries to restrict surge
Prices in Bangladesh, which imports the vegetable from India, reached an all-time high this week.
Onion price rise spreads to other Asian countries as key exporter India tries to restrict surge

Asian importers of Indian onions are struggling to secure supplies after New Delhi decided to make its exports costlier in order to rein in prices in its own market, Reuters reported on Friday.

Onions sold overseas by Indian traders must not be cheaper than `$850` (approximately Rs 54,826) per tonne till the end of the year, the government had said last week. This is making it difficult for traders in Bangladesh and Malaysia to buy the kitchen staple, which they used to buy from India for just around `$185` (Rs 11,932) a tonne in July.

“At the moment, there is nothing we can do but to wait,” Dhaka trader Mohammad Idris told Reuters. “We are hoping the price of onions will come down in India once their new harvest hits the markets.” Onion prices in Bangladesh have risen three times in just a few months, and were at an all-time high of 100 taka (Rs 78) per kg this week.

India is the world’s largest exporter of onions. However, record production last year led farmers to grow less onions this year to avoid losses, which has now pushed prices up. Earlier this week, retail prices in Delhi touched Rs 80 a kg.

When lack of supplies increases prices, the government imposes limits like the minimum export price, to discourage overseas traders from buying the commodity and allow more supplies to remain within the country.


#### 2017-12-01: Onion price slightly down, but still high
[Onion price slightly down, but still high ]

Onion prices have come down a little but are still way too high.

Yesterday, locally-grown onions were selling for Tk 90 a kg at the kitchen market in the capital's Karwan Bazar. However, the prices ranged between Tk 95 and Tk 100 in the grocery stores in the city.

Onions imported from India were being sold between Tk 75 and Tk 80 per kg.

A few days ago, the price of locally-produced onions shot up to Tk 100 and over after the neighbouring country imposed `$850` as Minimum Export Price for each tonne of onions.

India reset the MEP after nearly two years to increase supply in its domestic market and curb price hike there.

The country, which itself has a huge demand for the essential cooking ingredient, is a major source of onion for Bangladesh.

The retail prices in New Delhi have touched Rs 80 for a kg owing to tight supply, according to reports by some Indian media outlets.

That hike eventually had an impact on the Bangladeshi markets and the prices here spiralled, putting people in trouble.

“Onions have become too expensive,” Saiful Islam, who works at a private firm, had said after buying half a kg for Tk 50, a few days ago.

Onion prices which also rocketed outside the capital have started to drop.

For example, each kg of locally-grown and imported onions were selling for Tk 80 and Tk 65 in the kitchen markets in Dinajpur. They were higher the day before yesterday.

A week ago, the price of per kg of the imported ones was Tk 58.

Sirajul Islam, who runs a small restaurant in Dinajpur, said, "My family runs on the profit [of my business]. How can I do business if the price stays so high?"

Sheikh Ali Ahmed, a retired banker living in Khulna city, said he was struggling to meet his family expenses as the prices of other essentials, including rice, were too high.

Onion prices started soaring since flood hit the northern region of the country in August. That month, per kg of onions was sold at just Tk 25 per, said Asadul Islam, who lives in Dinajpur.

 Prices shot up further by the end of September and each kg of the imported onions was sold at Tk 65 in mid-October.

There was further price hike following crop loss in heavy rains in the neighbouring country.

Downpour also affected early varieties of locally grown onions at a time when old stocks were running out.

“Onion prices may remain at this level for another week,” Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital, said a few days ago.

Harun Ur Rashid, president of Importers and Exporters Group of Hili Land Port, said onion prices were soaring in the Indian domestic market. Besides, bad weather and flood in August also damaged onion fields, he said.

Harun said traders were losing interest in importing onions from India because of the `$850` MEP.

Importers could import onions at `$500` per tonne prior to India's move, according to traders.

The latest MEP for onion exports will remain effective until December 31, the Director General of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India said in a notification on November 23.

Narayan said prices of onions may drop in the coming months because of arrival of early varieties of locally grown bulbs.

“We are also getting onions imported from China and Egypt.”

Harun urged the Bangladesh government to facilitate faster import of bulb onions from other countries.


#### 2017-12-08 (NDTV): Why onion prices will remain volatile till the end of this month

Mumbai:  Onions saw a spike in prices over the last two weeks and much of it has to do with what happens in Maharashtra and Lassalgaon where most of the onion grown in Nashik is traded and sent to different parts of the country. Prices have now fallen but are yet to stabilize. The volatility in prices, traders say, will continue till the end of this month and prices will go down to early November levels once the fresh stock arrives in the market.

Onion prices had touched an yearly high last week going at almost Rs. 80 a kilogram. This week, prices have come down to Rs. 60 but likely to hover around 50 to 60 rupees till the end of December. 

The humble onion has seen a sharp spike in prices mostly due to the lack of supply. Traders at Mumbai's Dadar sabzi mandi or vegetable market say the trend is likely to continue till the end of this month because that's when the fresh stock will start arriving in the markets in full swing. 

Nashik in Maharashtra produces the largest quantity of onions in the country. Wholesale prices there touched an yearly high of Rs. 40 per kilogram last week. By the time it reached the main wholesale market in Navi Mumbai, the prices hit 50  to 55 rupees for a kilogram.

Ashok Varun, an onion Trader at a wholesale market in Navi Mumbai told NDTV, "Extra rainfall was witnessed after the monsoon months of June, July, August and September, a lot of onion crops were spoilt. Due to this, the crops which we usually start receiving during the time of Diwali were late."

By the time it reaches the wholesale market at Dadar in Mumbai, prices reach Rs. 60 to 70 for a kilogram and the consumer buys it from the retailer at Rs. 80 a kilogram. 

Hiraman Pardeshi, an onion trader in Nashik, told NDTV, "Four days ago, in the district of Nashik the rates of onion were between Rs. 2,000-4,000. Due to the increased rates of export duty the demand in the country has decreased and onion is not being exported."

With the ban on export and the decision to import 2,000 tonnes of onion, consumers, however, will get some relief from the spike in prices the government hopes. 

#### 2017-12-09: Overheated onion market likely to cool down in 2 weeks

UNB, Dhaka
The prices of onion, an essential kitchen vegetable, are expected to go down within the next two weeks with the arrival of new harvest, bringing a relief to consumers.

The onion prices have hit the roof with the consumers buying it at Tk 80 to 100 due to the recent flood and its curb on export by neighbouring India to keep stable its internal market.

According to official and private sources, onions produced during the Robi season will be enough to meet the country's demand throughout the year and the crisis will be over with the arrival of the new harvest.

The demand for onion in the country is around 22-24 lakh metric tonnes a year, while 18.66 lakh metric tonnes were produced last year, 1.31 lakh more than the previous year. Besides, 10.41 lakh metric tonnes were imported.

Onion prices started soaring after floods hit the country's northern region in August. Its price shot up further at the end of September and mid-October. "This is the time when onion prices remain high every year," said an official wishing not to be named.

The price hike of onion in neighbouring India, a major source of country's onion, due to crop loss in heavy rains also had an impact on price spiral of onion in Bangladesh.

Sultan, an onion farmer from Rajshahi's Ishwardi upazila, told UNB that the production this year was healthy, which will be enough to cover their losses over the last two years.

He said this year the cost of producing a kilogram of onion ranged between from Tk 20 to 22, which they could sell to local wholesalers at Tk 60 per kg, even up to Tk 65 if they could sell it to the wholesalers in Dhaka directly.

In the last two weeks, he said, they will be able to sell more of their stock, which will enable them to sell it in between Tk 45-55, allowing its retail price to decrease gradually.

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, onions are produced in almost all the districts of the country, but commercially more so in Pabna, Faridpur, Kushtia and Rajshahi.

Faruk, an employee at Janata Agency in Dhaka's Shyam Bazar, said local onions are selling at wholesale at between Tk 65 and Tk 75 per kg, while its Indian variety at between Tk 55 and 65.

In retail markets, however, the local onions are selling at Tk 90-95 per kg, while the Indian kind at Tk 80-85.

Retail traders are claiming that as the new stock of onions have still not hit the market, the prices remain high.

Golam Rahman, president of Consumers' Association of Bangladesh, said a group of unscrupulous traders may be behind the astronomical price of onions, as there is no logic for its price despite adequate supply.

But, he said, the price is affected due to similar conditions in India.

He said this scenario will continue until and unless the government keeps track of actual production figures and ensures strict monitoring of pricing at wholesale and retail level.

Golam Rahman was hopeful that the prices of onions will go down very soon.

#### 2017-12-10: Onion selling at Tk 120 a kg
Locally grown, they sold at Tk 85-95 a kg in city retail markets a week ago
[Onion selling at Tk 120 a kg ]
Staff Correspondent
Onion prices shot up to Tk 120 per kg in the kitchen markets of the city, an average rise of 28 percent from last week.

Yesterday, locally-grown onions were selling for Tk 110-Tk 120 per kg at retail in kitchen markets while the same quantity sold for Tk 85-95 a week ago.

Prices of imported onions also rose and were being sold for Tk 80- Tk 90 per kg yesterday, up from Tk 75- Tk 85 a week ago, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

“It appears that beggars will seek onions instead of taka the way prices are going up,” said an annoyed Md Shihab Uddin, who works at a private firm.

He said he was buying fewer onions expecting a fall in price owing to the arrival of a fresh harvest.

Traders said consumers will have to wait for two to three weeks to see increased supply of the essential cooking ingredient and buy the vegetable at lower prices.

However, some traders warned that arrival of early varieties of onions may be delayed owing to bad weather and yesterday's rainfall.

Prices of imported onions increased following imposition of `$850` as Minimum Export Price for each tonne of onions by the Indian authority.

India reset the MEP after nearly two years to increase supply in its domestic market and curb price hike there.

“The market has become dependent on Indian onions as stock of locally grown bulbs has almost exhausted. Besides, we had onions imported from other countries,” said Narayan Chandra Saha, a wholesaler at Shyambazar market in the capital.

Some 90 percent stock of local onion has already been used up, he said.

“Increased imports will help cool down the prices,” said Mohammad Aminul Islam, another onion wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, a major kitchen market in Dhaka.

He said supply of locally grown onion declines fast in the major growing regions such as Pabna.

“Early harvested onions have started coming to the market. But the current rainfall will affect onion fields. A portion of the bulbs in the fields will be damaged if the rainfall continues for longer. The wet weather will affect harvest, supply and prices of onion,” he said.

“Cultivation is good. But it may take a month for enough availability of onion in the market,” he said.

Mohammad Mazed, secretary of Shyambazar Onion Samity, said a large amount of onions was damaged in the field due to the unseasonal rains in October. The recent rainfall is likely to affect crop too, he said.

He said prices of imported onions have dropped to Tk 63-64 per kilogram at wholesale at Shyambazar yesterday from Tk 67-68 couple of days ago.

“Supply has been short in India,” he said.

On import from other countries, he said some importers incurred losses due to a price fall after importing onions from countries such as Pakistan, China and Egypt prior and after Eid-ul-Azha in September.

That is why imports of onions from other countries have dipped, he said, adding that prices are likely to remain high for the next three weeks. But prices may not go up too much, he said.

In the last fiscal year, 15 lakh tonnes of onions were exported.

The Department of Agricultural Extension has targeted to bring 2.15 lakh hectares of land for onion cultivation during the 2017-18 fiscal year, up from 2.13 lakh hectares the previous year.

Onion production rose seven percent to 18.66 lakh tonnes in the 2016-17 fiscal year, up from 17.35 lakh tonnes the previous year, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).

## 2017-12-04(DS):Why not one ministry for school education?
Manzoor Ahmed

There is sometimes a jostling about which of the two ministers of education should represent Bangladesh in any international forum for education, such as a Unesco meeting or a UN System consultation in relation to the SDGs.

Going by international protocol, the Minister of Education is invited and he, rather than the Minster of Primary and Mass Education, ends up attending these fora, even when the agenda concerns primary and basic education or literacy, which are often the focus of much of international cooperation in education.

Bangladesh is the only country in the world with two separate ministries managing school education.

The Ministry for Primary and Mass Education has the responsibility for the pre-primary to class five level while the Ministry of Education administers education for classes 6-12. Why do we need separate ministries for school education? This stands as a major obstacle to decision-making and implementation of essential reforms, as explained below.

The Ministry of Education (MOE) of the People's Republic of China, for instance, is the single agency that regulates the national education system including compulsory basic education, vocational education, and tertiary education.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development in India is divided into two departments: the Department of School Education and Literacy, which deals with primary, secondary and higher secondary education, adult education and literacy; and the Department of Higher Education, which deals with university education, technical education, scholarship, etc.

Some countries have a separate ministry-level agency for higher and professional education, but nowhere is the management of school education split between two national ministries. There is a good reason for this universal practice: the need to plan and manage school education in an integrated and holistic manner.

The separate Division of Primary and Mass Education was created in 1992 to provide a momentum to compulsory primary education and adult literacy when the Education For All programme was adopted globally in 1990. But the division was turned into a separate ministry in 2002, driven by the age-old bureaucratic tendency that keeps an agency growing even when it has outlived its useful life span.

Of course, which minister should represent Bangladesh in international meetings is not the main problem. There are other more substantive issues. At least three kinds of complications arise from the divided planning and management jurisdiction for school education.

First, the global sustainable development goal regarding education (SDG 4) specifies equitable, inclusive, high quality and free primary and secondary education by 2030 for all children, as well as lifelong learning for all. Bangladesh would be missing a key feature of a middle-income country if it cannot ensure universal and compulsory primary and secondary education for all children.

It is essential to plan and manage school education as one unified effort instead of focusing on primary education only, which originally prompted the creation of the separate primary education division in the Prime Minister's Office, which later became a full ministry.

Second, compulsory education is still limited to schooling up to grade five, though education up to grade eight was recommended as the domain of compulsory education in the first post-liberation education commission in 1974. This was re-affirmed in the Education Policy 2010. However, looking at the task primarily as shifting the jurisdiction from one ministry to another, and a turf battle about resolving the related practical and logistical problems, stymied the effort.

Even half of the children in the age for grades 6-8 today are not completing this level of education. And little attention is being paid to improving school facilities, teachers and what students learn at this level. The idea of universal secondary education has not registered even on the distant radar sight of the authorities. The question can no longer be ignored, if SDG 2030 targets are to be taken seriously.

Third, a unified vision of compulsory basic education that extends to 10th grade, and eventually 12th grade, calls for a unified approach for the key actions. These include designing the curricula with continuity and right sequence, preparing teachers in huge numbers and ensuring their professional quality, and assessing and monitoring learning both in school and through appropriate (and not too frequent) public examinations.

All of these tasks are now divided between two ministries without the much-needed holistic view—the way these things are managed in all other countries.

A central authority responsible only for the overall strategic changes, policy direction, setting national standards and consensus building should be the goal for transformation in education governance. Greater decentralisation and decisions closer to where the beneficiaries are—at the district, upazila and school levels—in a responsive and participatory way, should be the guiding principle. Thus, the one national ministry for education need not be over-burdened.

A certain way of thinking and set of habits have developed through a generation of the divided but over-centralised management of school education and a reductionist vision of education accepting grade-five primary education as the state's obligation. This is no longer acceptable.

A permanent and statutory education commission was foreseen in the National Education Policy 2010 to guide and maintain an oversight of transformation of the education sector to serve national aspirations and the challenges of the 21st century. It is high time to act on this proposal.

An education system that envisions universal primary and secondary education with quality and equity in line with the imperatives of a middle-income country and the SDG 4 education targets should be the pledge of the political parties intending to compete in the next parliamentary election.

Political commitment should be integrated with a holistic planning and management of the education sector through one national centre of authority. What can be a more important item in the political manifesto?

## 2017-07-25(DS): Of what value is primary school completion?
[Of what value is primary school completion?]
Source: globalpartnership.org
John Richards and Shahidul Islam

Nearly all children now enrol in grade 1 and 80 percent are reaching grade 5, currently the final year of primary schooling. In the Primary Education Completion Exam (PECE), a mandatory national exam introduced in 2009, the latest pass rate is 98.5 percent. This is a success that cannot be ignored.

But can students who complete primary school read and do simple sums? A recent survey we conducted revealed that among children who had reached grade 5 (but not higher), 72 percent could read a grade 2 level story and only 40 percent could solve grade 2 level subtraction problems. In a large-scale national survey commissioned by the Directorate of Primary Education, only 25 percent of grade 5 students performed “at grade level” in Bangla and math. 

PECE has led to a large increase in parents paying teachers to be tutors for children preparing for the exam. Many are concerned that tutors spend too much time making students memorise probable PECE questions, often using commercial guide books rather than helping students learn basic skills, and that grading of the PECE exam does not tell us what children really learn.

Seeking clues to this puzzle, we conducted a pilot survey in Nilphamari to measure student learning in reading and mathematics. We selected children who were in primary school or had completed grade 5 but did not go beyond. About 75 percent of the sampled children were attending or had attended a government primary school, about 20 percent an NGO school, and five percent a private school. The questions we asked on Bangla and math were simple, based on elements of the grade 2 Bangladesh government school curriculum.

We were inspired by the work of ASER, a non-profit learning survey organisation in India. Aser in Hindi means impact; the letters also stand for Annual Status of Education Report. Their premise is that children with primary education should be able to read, write and do basic sums—at least at the grade 2 level.

For the last decade, ASER has conducted surveys of primary school age children throughout rural India. Students are considered literate if they can read a short simple story with no more than three errors. They are considered numerate if they can solve two two-digit subtraction problems, requiring carryover.* What ASER found has generated a national public debate about the state of education in India. It has inspired a similar annual survey in Pakistan. 

In our sample, 30 percent of children who reached up to grade 3 could read the story and 18 percent could solve the two subtraction problems. Children who had reached grade 5 did better, but more than a quarter could not read the grade 2 level story and 60 percent could not do the simple subtractions. 

In ASER's 2016 survey, the comparable results across India were, in grade 3, 25 percent able to read the story and 28 percent able to do the subtractions. In grade 5, 48 percent could read the story and 51 percent could solve the two subtraction problems. Our sample students performed above the Indian average in reading, but below in arithmetic. Surely, these results are unacceptable for either country! 

We draw two conclusions from the pilot. A simple survey should be part of a regular nationwide assessment of student learning and used as a measure for tracking change in primary education and making quality improvement decisions. 

Second, PECE not only gives wrong signals about student outcomes, but also subverts the learning process. It should be discontinued. Genuine assessment of actual competency—an ASER approach as part of it—should be used. 

The government and development partners are currently engaged in planning the next phase of the Primary Education Development Program. This is the perfect time to consider these ideas.

We used the story in ASER's 2014 survey. It is of similar difficulty to grade 2 Bangla textbooks. Here is the translation:

“Tithi is the only daughter in the family. Dad and Mom love her very much. She likes to eat fish. Her father brings fish home every day. She then keeps hanging around her Mom. When the fish is fried in oil, she becomes very happy. Tithi eats three to four pieces of fish altogether. Father takes Tithi to the market. Some days father brings hilsha fish from the market. On those days, Tithi's happiness has no limits.”

A typical subtraction problem required subtraction of 36 from 73.

## 2017-07-03(DS) Why so many children out of school?

It is disheartening to note that there are about 10 million out-of-school children, adolescents and youths in Bangladesh, as revealed by a new Unesco policy paper. Some of the reasons mentioned in the paper as to why that is the case were related to their living conditions, financial constraints and social adversities. 

Data from the study shows that approximately 7.1 million youths and 2 million adolescents in the country are not attending school. Despite the progress that has been made in the education sector over the years, the statistics clearly show that there is still room for much improvement, as Bangladesh right now has the fifth highest number of out-of-school adolescents and the third largest number of out-of-school youths in the world, only ahead of India and Pakistan. 

Other studies have shown, meanwhile, that education has both direct and indirect impacts on economic growth and poverty reduction. One of Unesco's own report suggests that with only minor improvements in the education sector, the world poverty rate could be reduced quite drastically. Thus, education is obviously a worthwhile investment. So what are the steps that the government is taking to address this shortfall? What programmes does it plan on introducing to plug the lacuna?

These are questions that the authorities should seriously consider. Moreover, the authorities should also come up with concrete plans to address the shortfalls in the sector and try to bring all youths and adolescents under the umbrella of having a decent education.

## 2017-07-01(DS): Education a mirage for them
Bangladesh has nearly 10m children, adolescents and youths who are not enrolled at school

There are about 10 million out-of-school children, adolescents and youths in Bangladesh, says a new Unesco policy paper.

The country has the fifth highest number of out-of-school adolescents and the third largest number of out-of-school youths in the world.

The total number of out-of-school children (6-11), adolescents (12-14) and youths (15-17) across the globe is nearly 264 million, says the paper, titled “Reducing global poverty through universal primary and secondary education”.

It was released last week ahead of the UN High Level Political Forum starting on July 10 in New York. The forum would focus on poverty eradication in pursuit of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The out-of-school population includes children who were in school but have since dropped out, who were never in school but are expected to enter at a later period and also those who were never in school and are not expected to enroll ever.

The global primary out-of-school rate has remained static for eight years in a row, said the paper, adding that global poverty could be more than halved almost within a generation if all adults completed secondary school.

Data compiled by the Unesco Institute for Statistics (UIS) shows that Bangladesh has 7.1 million out-of-school youths, the third highest in the world after India (46.8 million) and Pakistan (9.8 million).

There are two million out-of-school adolescents in Bangladesh, fifth highest in the world with India (11.1m), Pakistan (5.4m), Ethiopia (4.6m) and Indonesia (2.2m) topping the first four slots in the category.

With 0.8 million children (primary age-level) out-of-school in the country, Bangladesh fared comparatively better in this category compared to higher numbers in the adolescent and youth categories.

According to the draft of Bangladesh Education Statistics 2016, over 2.87 crore students are currently studying in primary and secondary schools. Last year, the net enrolment rate at primary level stood at 97.96 percent and 73.10 at secondary level.

The Unesco paper says six countries are home to more than one-third of all out-of-school children of primary age. They are Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sudan. Globally, there are 61 million children of primary school age who are out-of-school right now.

It says: "Far too many children, adolescents and youth are still out-of-school for multiple reasons relating to their living conditions, financial constraints and social adversities.”

While it is very challenging to bring out-of-school youth back to education, there is also a worrying slowdown in the pace at which the world's children and adolescents are being integrated into national education systems, it said.

The global number of total out-of-school population has dropped from over 374 million in 2000 to 264 million now, the Unesco report notes, adding that the out-of-school rate has not budged since 2008 at the primary level, since 2012 at the lower secondary level and since 2013 at the upper secondary level.

Unesco's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) report shows that nearly 60 million people could escape poverty if all adults had just two more years of schooling. If all adults completed secondary education, 420 million people could be lifted out of poverty, reducing the total number of poor people by more than half globally and by almost two-thirds in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, says the paper.

Studies have shown that education has direct and indirect impacts on both economic growth and poverty. Education provides skills that boost employment opportunities and income while helping to protect people from socio-economic vulnerabilities. A more equitable expansion of education is likely to reduce inequality, lifting the poorest from the bottom of the ladder, said the report.

Despite education's potential, new UIS data shows that there has been virtually no progress in reducing out-of-school rates in recent years, according to the report.

Globally, nine percent of all children of primary school age are still denied their right to education, with rates reaching 16 percent and 37 percent for youth of lower and upper secondary ages, respectively. 

Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest out-of-school rates for all age groups. Of the 61 million children of primary school age currently out of school, 17 million will never set foot in a classroom if current trends continue, it said.

Girls in poor countries continue to face particularly steep barriers to education. According to UIS data, in low-income countries, more than 11 million girls of primary age are out of school, compared to almost 9 million boys. The good news is that the girls who do manage to start school tend to complete the primary cycle and pursue their studies at the secondary level, added the Unesco paper. 

## 2017-06-21(DS): Madrassahs: The invisible link in achieving equity
Shagufe Hossain

Since the World Conference on Women in Mexico in 1975, Bangladesh has been at the forefront among the least-developed countries (LDCs) in addressing gender disparities. The country's achievements in education and gender parity in education, has also been remarkable. However, despite its success in achieving gender parity in many areas, some sections of the population have been left behind. One such section is female students in madrassah schools.

Arguably, much of the frequently cited increase in enrolment rate and gender parity in education can be accounted for by a rise and recent reform in the madrassah sector. A study by Dr. Niaz Asadullah, Professor of Development Economics in the Faculty of Economics at Malaya University, found that nearly half of the student population in these madrassahs today is female. Musammat Badrunnesha, Echidna Global Scholar and Christina Kwauk, Postdoctoral Fellow — Global Economy and Development, Centre for Universal Education, reported in a study that madrassahs provide education to over 1.5 million girls in Bangladesh. Despite accounting for a large percentage of the student population, female students graduating from this medium of education are seen to frequently disappear from the workforce. In fact, whatever research exists indicate that the majority of girls enrolled in the system will not transition to university or the workforce.

One may be curious as to why this sector has fallen behind in comparison to the rest of the nation. There are several reasons, some of which are historical. During the language movement in 1952, madrassahs were placed in an awkward position because of a strong emphasis on Urdu in the curriculum before 1971. After the country's liberation, some madrassahs continued their curriculum in Urdu and some did not. However, the sector has often been seen as a ground for breeding anti-nationalist and anti-state sentiments amongst students. The international community has also regarded madrassahs as the breeding ground for terrorism, based on the fundamentalist ideologies that they are assumed to promote by virtue of their religious orientation.

On the other hand, madrassahs themselves have also resisted external interventions from NGOs. When NGOs first started operating in Bangladesh, they were often allegedly formed as part of Christian missionary organisations and undertook charitable activities in underdeveloped areas in order to convert people to Christianity. So, as a result of being perceived as having evangelical agendas, NGOs were seen by madrassahs as existential threats.

Despite madrassah's complicated relationship with the state and the international community, madrassahs have been far from irrelevant. Of the two kinds of madrassahs, i.e. alia and qawmi, alia madrassahs are becoming more relevant among parents who wish for their children to obtain marketable skills but at the same time develop proficiency of the Quran and Hadith.

For those communities where religious schooling is the only socially acceptable form of education for adolescent girls, parents are reluctant to send their daughters to secular schools despite the provision of cash or food subsidies. By virtue of observing Islamic religious teachings — for example, about girls and boys occupying separate spaces — madrassahs help allay fears and concerns of many parents about protecting the honour of their daughters while in school. For religiously minded parents, alia madrassahs offering both secular and religious education provide a comforting response to the social influence of a rapidly globalising world.

Parents from various socio-economic strata are turning away from “regular” state schools to madrassahs to help preserve the social values of society, and they are choosing to send their daughters to madrassahs with the belief that madrassahs are safer for girls. Studies suggest that marriage-related motivations also influence parental choice of schooling for girls since it is perceived that madrassah education instils traditional values that make their daughters more eligible in the marriage market. Under the circumstances, alia madrassahs have become the preferred form of schooling for the more religiously minded communities in the country providing education opportunity to over 1.5 million girls in Bangladesh.

However, the Madrassah Education Board of Bangladesh reports on average, 33 percent fewer girls sit for their grade 10 examinations than on the grade 8 examinations. By the time they sit for their grade 12 examinations, 79 percent of girls from the original cohort have disappeared from school. Furthermore, only a small percentage of girls attending madrassahs will enter the labour market. While it may be convenient to take the stance that madrassahs should be replaced with secular schools, or left to themselves, madrassahs will simply become irrelevant as a result of outdated curriculum and schools of thought; current trends do not indicate that the medium will be replaced with secular schooling any time soon. In such a case then, at least explore, if not accommodate for the sector, comprising of such large numbers.

Real progress in society is achieved only through inclusion. The lack of information about the sector other than politicised information combined with the guarded nature within the community leads to misconceptions or non-conceptions, further breeding mistrust and in turn leading to the female sector of the population becoming one of the most marginalised communities of the country. Therefore, there is a need for both government and non-government bodies to design interventions that can successfully reach and cater to this population so that equity is achieved.

## 2016-07-31(DS): Change law to bar MPs in educational instt: HC
high-court

Star Online Report

The High Court today directed the authorities concerned to take steps in two months for amending the provisions of a law that allows lawmakers to become chairman of the governing bodies of private educational institutions.

The directive comes weeks after the HC declared illegal the provision of Non-government School College Governing Body Regulation-2009 that enables the MPs to head the governing bodies.

The court also ordered formation of ad-hoc committees at private educational institutions in 30 days to hold elections to the governing bodies.

The High Court on June 1 declared illegal the rules that were allowing the lawmakers to become chiefs of the committees of the educational institutions.

The HC delivered the verdict hearing two separate writ petitions filed by SC lawyer Eunus Ali Akond challenging the legality of the provision.

The petitioners alleged that several ruling party lawmakers flout government rules to become chairmen of governing bodies of private educational institutions in their constituencies.

They also allegedly nominate their relatives for the post in a bid to appoint teachers of their choice.

There are over 18,500 non-government secondary schools in the country and all of them are being run by their governing bodies.

Star Online Report

The government has proposed raising allocation in the education sector by 32 percent to Tk 49,009 crore in the next fiscal year compared to the allocation in the outgoing FY.

In his budget proposals, placed in parliament today, AMA Muhith set aside an allocation of Tk 26,847 crore for the education ministry and another Tk 22,162 crore for primary and mass education ministry.

"We have attached top priority to education and human resource development. Considering the expenditure in education sector as long term investment, we have taken various programmes to develop this sector," he said.

The minister said they would continue the existing programmes including distribution of books and learning materials, appointment of teachers and their training, and construction and reconstruction of primary schools and training institutes.

He urged the private sectors to come forward in constructing 63,000 classrooms as government's initiative in this area is quiet inadequate due to capacity limitation.

Muhith said due to lack of proper maintenance, many buildings in educational institutions of primary to higher education levels are in dilapidated state.

He proposed to allocate a total of Tk 200 crore for the purpose of renovating dilapidated schools in the budget. A policy, to this end, will be finalised within two months, he said.

He also proposed to allocate Tk 500 crore as endowment fund and Tk 100 crore as one-time grant to 'Non-Government Education Institute Retirement Benefit Board' for welfare of the non-government teachers.

In addition, he proposed to allocate Tk 50 crore for 'Non-Government Teachers and Employees Welfare Trust'.

## 2016-04-17(DS): Grabbers feast on Dhaka schools
Initiative to recover 23 primary institutions sees almost no progress in over 1yr
[Grabbers feast on Dhaka schools]

Gendaria Mahila Samity Govt Primary School has over 1,650 students but its compound is so small that just a 10th of the children face difficulty in playing in the ground during recess.

Children cannot walk three abreast in the narrow passage from the gate to the main building. "We cannot even do students' assemblies properly due to space shortage," said Riaz Parvez, head teacher of the school.

It was not supposed to be like this since the 66-year-old school owns 37.36 decimal of land.

However, only around 12.5 decimal is in its possession. The rest of the land has been under the illegal occupation for a long time.

Occupying three decimal of the school's land in the front, Gendaria Mahila Samity constructed six shops and rented them out. Two organisations -- Shimanta Khelaghar Ashor and Shimanta Library -- are running their activities on the school land building their own walls, according to a report of a sub-committee of parliamentary standing committee on primary and mass education ministry.

For a long time efforts were being made by the authorities to evict the illegal occupants but to no avail. Members of the sub-committee visited the school around a year and a half ago and had recommended in its report to evict the shops, but that too never happened.

"We're facing extreme difficulties due to the shortage of classrooms. The standing committee even recommended constructing a new building but that could not be done due to lack of land," said the head teacher.

This school is one of the 23 state-run primary schools in the capital whose land have been illegally occupied and the sub-committee visited, said the district primary education office (DPEO) of Dhaka.

The DPEO submitted a report to Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) on March 30 with “progress” about its efforts to recover land.

The Daily Star correspondents visited four such schools earlier this month and found the land of the schools was still under the occupation of government bodies and influential people.

ALMOST NO PROGRESS

In September, 2014, the then Dhaka district primary education officer submitted a report to the primary and mass education ministry saying that land of 54 state-run primary schools had been occupied illegally.

Later, the sub-committee of the parliamentary standing committee visited 23 schools in December that year and in January last year as these schools had more problems than the rest, Shaheen Ara Begum, district primary education officer of Dhaka, told The Daily Star.

The sub-committee led by AKM Zahangir Hossain MP submitted its report with findings and recommendations. It has held four meetings so far and asked DPEO in its last meeting in December last year to come up with a progress report on the recovery of land.

But the actions, in almost all the cases, were limited only to sending letters to different offices, according to the March 30 progress report. The report mentioned that some portions of land of three schools had been recovered.

"It takes time since recovering land is a long process. But many progresses have been made," Shaheen Ara told The Daily Star.

Some sensitive and public interest issues were involved and that was why they had to move slowly and carefully, she claimed.

Dhaka Wasa, for example, installed water pumps on school land and those cannot be removed immediately. In a few places the land were being occupied by slums of Urdu-speaking people, she said.

Visiting Gendaria Mahila Samity Govt Primary School, it was found that the classrooms were crammed with children.

Due to the classroom crisis, the school authorities built two small classrooms on the compound. "But that too was inadequate. Notices were served and letters were sent, but nothing happened," said head teacher Riaz Parvez.

The sub-committee in its report said educational environment was being hampered. It recommended demolishing the shops and breaking the wall between the school and Shimanta Library.

Contacted, Kazi Sultan Ahmed Tokon, general secretary of Shimanta Library, claimed the government allotted the land for Shimanta Library in 1964. Shimanta Khelaghar Ashor is an organisation of the library, he said.

He said the school authorities were falsely claiming that they own the entire land showing fake mutation papers. "They showed the fake papers to the ministry [sub-committee] and convinced them," he told The Daily Star.

Despite repeated attempts, this newspaper could not get Gendaria Mahila Samity's comments.

The DPEO only sent a letter to the deputy commissioner to evict the shops.

"We've sent a proposal to DPE for construction of a new building as per the recommendation of the sub-committee," said DPEO Shaheen Ara.

The case of FKM Government Primary School is deplorable.

Privately-run Bangshal Girls' High School authorities started using the classrooms of FKM in 1988, following a government temporary permission.

The Bangshal school uses 26 rooms on the first and second floors of the primary school, according to the sub-committee report.

The school even introduced a primary section without approval, disrupting the academic activities of the FKM school, said the report, recommending shutting down the primary level operations of Bangshal school.

It suggested that the possession of the first floor be returned to of FKM school.

But the suggestion remains in paper only.

The Daily Star found FKM running academic activities in six shabby rooms on the ground floor. There are six shops at the entrance to the building.

"We struggle to accommodate 260 students in six rooms. But when it rains the floor of the school corridor and classrooms go under water," said Kazi Laila Akhter, head teacher of FKM Government Primary School.

"We've repeatedly requested the [high] school authorities to vacate at least the first floor, but they didn't pay any heed," she said, adding that the high school authorities occasionally rents out the hall room on the third floor.

Mizanur Rahman, acting headmaster of Bangshal High School, refuted the allegations.

"We want to give them the first floor, but who will compensate us. We spent money for constructing the floors," he said. The school land is a Waqf property and therefore they have the same rights like that of the primary school, he claimed.

Again, the DPEO sent letter to DPE to write to Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education for shutting the primary section of the Bangshal school and handing floor over to FKM.

"We've sent letters to deputy commissioner for evicting the shops," said Shaheen Ara.

Suritola Model Govt Primary School in Old Dhaka has some other problems. The school was in the list of 54 schools, but was not one that the sub-committee had visited.

Apart from a water pump set up by Wasa on its land, the authorities of the privately-run Ramna Railway High School, now renamed as Suritola High School, holds classes on the third and fourth floors of the school building.

In 1989, the government acquired the land on which Ramna Railway High School stood, near the Osmani Auditorium. Following demonstrations by teachers and students, the government allowed it to temporarily hold classes in Suritola primary school.

But they never got their own place.

"As per the government rules, our school schedule is from 7:30am to 2:15pm, and Ramna school starts after noon. Due to conflicting school times, we need to share the classrooms to accommodate students of both schools," said A Rahman, head teacher of Suritola primary school, which has around 928 students.

"No doubt, Ramna school is an education institute where children of this area are studying. But running the schools together is a problem. We want the government to change the school timings for the benefit of students of both schools," the head teacher said.

An influential person has built a five-storey building on a portion of the land of MA Alim Govt Primary School in Sutrapur.

On the other side of the school compound, the four-storey building of the school has eight rooms.

The school has no room for playground.

The sub-committee recommended filing a case with the land tribunal.

The DPEO only asked the thana education officer to file the case.

Some Urdu-speaking people constructed rooms on 30 decimals of a 36-decimal plot belonging to Shahin Govt Primary School in Mohammadpur, the progress report said.

The sub-committee suggested making a list of them before evicting them. The DPEO only served a letter to the local ward commissioner to this end.

Nazira Bazar Govt Primary School, Chhoto Katra Govt Primary School, Shishu Shikhkha Samity Govt Primary School, Bangla Bazar Govt Primary School, Gabtoli Govt Primary School, Pallabi Govt Primary School, Bonoful Govt Primary School, Abdul Mannan Govt Primary School, Khalilur Rahman Govt Primary School, Taltola Govt Primary School, Borabo Govt Primary School, Dhanmondi 1-no Govt Primary School, Motijheel Govt Primary School, Dilkusa Govt Primary School, P & T Govt Primary School, Khilgaon Staff Quarter Govt Primary School, No-37 Dharmik Para Govt Primary School, Matuail Paschim Para Govt Primary School, and Brahman Chiran Govt Primary School are on the list of schools whose land had been occupied by government bodies or influential individuals.

Sub-committee chief AKM Zahangir Hossain said, "We've asked them [DPE and the ministry] to give a follow-up report about the schools in the next meeting [of the standing committee] either end of this month or on early next month. Getting the report, we'll take our next step."

## 2016-04-10(DS): Too eager to get new laws
Little interest in enforcing existing ones on guide book, education
Shakhawat Liton and Wasim Bin Habib

It is easier to make a new law than the enforcement and modification of an existing one. The proposed legislation on education is the latest glaring example of this popular saying in our country.

A provision of the proposed education law slaps a ban on publishing notes or guidebooks for primary and secondary levels education. In so doing, those who drafted the proposal have overlooked a three-decade old law that serves the same purpose with a provision for more stringent punishment.

Whoever will publish notes or guidebooks, according to the proposed law drafted by the education ministry, will be punished with a jail term of up to six months or a fine of up to Tk 2 lakh or both.

But the Note-Books (Prohibition) Act of 1980 has long ago criminalised printing, publication, import, distribution and sale of note-books on text-books for primary and secondary schools up to class VII.

The charge of violating the law carries jail term of up to seven years and a fine of up to Tk 25,000 or both. In addition, the court may order the forfeiture to the government of every copy of the notes or guidebooks and the printing press found printing such notes-books, according to the law of 1980.

In exercise of the power of the law of 1980, mobile courts in past had launched anti-guidebooks drive in Dhaka and various districts and seized huge number of notes and guidebooks and imposed fines on the sellers of those banned books.

Yet, the market remains flooded with notes and guidebooks with different names for different classes.

In such a situation, the proposed education law has slapped the ban on notes-guidebooks with a provision for lesser punishment.

The proposed law also sought to make the pre-primary and primary education compulsory for all children. Again, those who drafted the provision have ignored a law enacted in 1990 making the primary education compulsory.

The government has enacted the law detailing the procedure for introduction of compulsory primary education for children.

However, the law has a provision asking the government to specify, in official gazette, the areas where the primary education will be made compulsory.

It has also made it mandatory for every guardian of the areas specified in the official gazette to send their children to schools and on failure a guardian may face punitive action, according to the law making primary education compulsory.

Since their enactment, no amendment was brought to these two laws on note-books prohibition and making primary education compulsory. This also shows a lack of proper enforcement of them, which remain only in the book.

Under such a situation, those who are supposed to do extensive homework before drafting any proposal for enactment of the education law seem to have failed to do so in the last four years since they began the work in 2012.

If such a faulty proposal is placed in the parliament, what will our lawmakers do? Will they find out the loopholes in the proposed legislation during the debate on it, or will they just pass it in voice vote as they usually do?

## 2016-04-07(DS): Opinion: When did private tuition become a crime?
Sharier Khan
The education ministry has drafted a new law that will ban private tuition and coaching with the provision of hefty fines up to Taka 2 lakh along with six-month jail for the guilty tutors.

While one can understand that the draft Education Act, 2016 has good intentions, the idea may have unexpected implications.

We all know that the country’s education system in general has not become so efficient that all students are being attended by teachers properly. The quality of teachers and teaching remains a challenge not to speak about teacher-student ratio in classrooms.

Since when did private tuition become a crime? When did private tuition become synonymous to stealing, pick-pocketing or mugging that the ministry would think of putting a private tutor behind bars?

Private tuition had been there in our education system for ages because there had been always a shortage of quality teachers. Our grandfathers or fathers as students have earned their extra money to reduce burden on their parents. It used to be a matter of pride back then. After all teaching is an honourable profession.
But then of course, over time a section of money-hungry teachers of schools and colleges began unethically using private tuition for personal gains. They would not pay attention to teaching students in classes and force the students to come to them for private tuition just to pass the exams.
And that gradually has led to mushrooming of commercial coaching centres. There is of course the issue of money. But there is also the issue of learning.

Students would not go to private tutors if there was no need of it. Did the education ministry find the root cause why students go for private tuition? Ask anyone— he would say it is because of the weak teaching and classroom sessions. If the teaching and classrooms were stimulating enough, why would any young girl or boy want to waste their playtime hours learning the same things under a private tutor.

Students of some reputed private English medium schools in our country do not usually go for private tuition as their teachers are better qualified. But it’s mainly the problems with other schools—including the government ones.

If the government wants to end the malpractice of private tuition, it has to take measures to improve teachers’ quality by making the teaching profession more honourable and financially attractive. Banning private tuition just morally does not sound right.

So we believe the focus should have been on improving education quality. By any means.

## 2016-04-04(DS): How education and stimulation in early years can help children thrive for a lifetime
[How education and stimulation in early years can help children thrive for a lifetime]

Bjorn Lomborg

Today, 99 percent of Bangladesh's girls and 97 percent of boys are enrolled in primary school. The great progress in primary education over recent years is the reason that the country has met the two Millennium Development Goals related to primary schooling: universal enrollment and gender equality.

The rest of the education story, however, is not so good. Concerns remain over poor education quality, and enrollment rates beyond the primary level remain low. And one important concern for education is something that appears rather separate: stunting, or the condition of being shorter than normal for one's age. It matters, because it holds back learning and development.

Investment in education holds promise to help move Bangladesh closer to the goals of Vision 2021 and beyond. What are the best ways to address the issues faced by the country's education system? 

New research by economist Atonu Rabbani of the University of Dhaka suggests that there are several worthwhile strategies that could improve public education in Bangladesh. One is most promising of all: so-called psychosocial stimulation to help young children overcome stunting.

Six million Bangladeshi children, including 40 percent of kids under 5 years old, are stunted. It can be caused by inadequate nutrition or repeated infections during a child's first three years. The effects often last a lifetime: delayed cognitive development, lower productivity, poor health, and increased risk of certain diseases.

And the importance of early childhood development is crucial: Studies show that early development means higher intellectual achievement later in life, higher future income, and less criminal activities. It can even lead to better health outcomes. 

Fortunately, there's solid evidence for a strategy that can help stunted children overcome their early-life setbacks entirely and allow them to become just as healthy and productive later in life as their peers.

The analysis examined a project that was launched in 1986 in Jamaica. At the beginning of the study, stunted children between age 9-24 months lagged behind in both learning and productivity compared to non-stunted kids. During the course of the programme, stunted children were visited weekly by education social workers, who led play sessions to develop cognitive, language, and psychosocial skills. The visits lasted for two years, and the social workers also taught the mothers of the children how to do the same stimulating activities with their children, so the effort lasted beyond the workers' end date.

The results of the long-term study in Jamaica could hardly be believed - the psychosocial activities had negated all the deleterious effects of stunting. After 20 years, the children in the programme had completely made up the gap to their non-stunted peers, as demonstrated by their equal wage and earnings levels. Stunted children who were not part of the programme, however, earned 25 percent less than the wages of the treated and non-stunted groups.

When translated to Bangladesh, the cost of such a programme is one hour per week for a social worker for each child, which would equal Tk.12, 450 per child each year. And the benefits turn out to be incredible. An estimated wage increase of nearly 20 percent is worth more than Tk. 1.5 million (Tk. 15 lakh) for each child over their working career. Each taka spent on psychosocial stimulation programmes for early education of children would do Tk. 18 of benefits.

The benefits from the stimulation programme were most promising, but other strategies that the research examined held promise to do good as well.

Among the various programmes studied, “streaming,” or reassigning students into groups according to their levels of educational attainment, has shown promise to increase student achievement in a cost-effective manner. The experts conservatively estimate that in Bangladesh, every Tk. 7,800 spent on reassigning students according to their achievement levels could increase student test scores by nearly two standard deviations, which is correlated with earning higher future wages. The money would be spent throughout the five years of primary schooling and could also allow for hiring more teachers. Each taka spent toward these efforts would do about Tk. 12 of good.

On-the-job training for managers also appears to be a decent idea. It can help increase firm productivity and the wellbeing of employees, especially in sectors like the readymade garment industry, where schooling levels are actually lower for many new supervisors and managers. The return on investment in professional training would come from increased worker productivity. It may not be as large as human capital investment in early childhood, but it may be more in line with firms' incentives. Each taka spent on this sort of training would do Tk. 5 of good. A remaining challenge, however, is that there are still social norms that prevent women from achieving management roles, which hinders progress for many and contributes to lower productivity.

What do you think? Is investing in schooling, and in early childhood education in particular, the best way forward for Bangladesh? Earlier, we saw how improving migration opportunities could provide benefits. Where would you choose to spend money if you were in charge and wanted to do the most good for the country? Let us hear from you at https://copenhagen.fbapp.io/education. We want to continue the conversation about how Bangladesh can do the most good for every taka spent.

## 2016-02-21(DS): Education in Mother Language: 40% population denied globally
Says Unesco report
[Education in Mother Language: 40% population denied globally]

Though children should be taught in a language they speak or understand, as much as 40 percent of the global population does not have access to that kind of education.

The challenges are most prevalent in regions -- such as sub-Saharan Africa and Asia and the Pacific -- where linguistic diversity is the greatest, reveals a policy paper of the Unesco's Global Education Monitoring Report.

If children are taught in a language other than their own, it has a negative effect on learning, according to the paper styled "If you don't understand, how can you learn?" released on Friday, ahead of International Mother Language Day being observed worldwide today.

In Bangladesh, there are around 30 lakh people -- mainly indigenous -- whose mother tongues are not Bangla. Of them, some five lakh are children who have almost no access to education in their mother language, linguist Shourav Sikdar told The Daily Star.

Although the National Education Policy-2010 calls for steps to ensure education of the indigenous people in their mother tongues, the plan had not yet been implemented mainly due to bureaucratic tangles, said the professor of linguistics at Dhaka University.

Citing a 2012 survey, Mong Shanoo Chowdhury, a retired government college teacher in Rangamati, said the dropout rate among the indigenous children in the three hill districts was 65 percent.

"The main reason behind such a high dropout rate is they cannot pursue education in their mother language," he observed.

Prof Shourav, also a member of the government's Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education programme, said though some non-government organisations were working to provide education to indigenous children in their mother language, "it is very insufficient".

After formulating the new education policy, the government decided to print primary textbooks in five ethnic languages initially and deliver those to the indigenous children concerned by the beginning of 2014, he said.

"But it has not been done even in 2016."

Primary and Mass Education Minister Mostafizur Rahman could not be reached on his phone for comments despite several attempts.

Pursuing education in a language that is not spoken outside the classroom frequently holds back a child's learning, especially for those living in poverty, says the Unesco policy paper.

For instance, Farsi is the official language of instruction in Iran.

Around 20 percent of the fourth graders there taking the test in Farsi reported speaking a different language at home.

"Of these, 80 percent reached the basics in reading compared with over 95 percent of Farsi speakers," the report states.

In multi-ethnic societies, imposing a dominant language through a school system has frequently been a source of grievance linked to wider issues of social and cultural inequality, the Unesco paper finds.

For example, the post-independence government in Pakistan adopted Urdu as the national langue and the language of instruction in schools, which became a source of alienation in a country that was home to six major linguistic groups and 58 smaller ones.

"The failure to recognise Bengali, spoken by the vast majority of the population in [the then] East Pakistan, was one of the major sources of conflict within the new country, leading to the student riots [language movement] in 1952," it says.

In Pakistan, the continued use of Urdu as the language of instruction in government schools, even though it is spoken at home by less than eight percent of the population, has also contributed to political tensions, it adds.

The Unesco report recommended that at least six years of mother tongue-based education should be provided in ethnically diverse communities to ensure that those speaking a language different from the medium of instruction do not fall behind.

Bilingual or multilingual education programmes should be offered to ease the transition to the teaching of the official languages, it suggests.

To fully support the implementation of mother tongue-based bilingual/multilingual education programmes, teachers should be trained to teach in more than one language, it continues.

Policymakers need to focus on hiring and training teachers from linguistic and ethnic minorities to serve in the schools of their own communities, the paper states.

## 2017-10-29 Xi whizz: look at the emperor’s new clothes  
    October 29 2017, 12:01am, The Sunday Times
    Niall Ferguson
    Westerners who fawn over China’s leader are ignoring three crucial points
    An emperor who is a dotard. A population in the grip of opium addiction. An economy held back by bureaucracy and crumbling infrastructure. A culture fixated on past greatness but in fact hopelessly decadent. This was how westerners in the 18th and 19th centuries regarded China. It is how the Chinese (not to mention most Europeans) now regard the United States.
    Trumpery, the opioid epidemic, the administrative state, storm-ravaged cities and the fantasy of making America great again — America today cuts a sorry figure, whether you watch CCTV (Chinese state television) or the BBC. Compare and contrast with the way China is portrayed now in western media.
    Ever since President Xi Jinping’s triumphant appearance as the defender of free trade and champion of globalisation at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, there has been a striking trend: those commentators most averse to Donald Trump tend to be the most gushing in their praise of his Chinese counterpart.
    To The Economist, Xi Jinping is now “the world’s most powerful man”. Xi offers a “long-term view of China’s ambition”, declared the Financial Times last week. “This president has an iron grip on power and a strategy to reach global pre-eminence.” Followed by: “Beijing is gaining confidence that it can mix political control with growth and innovation.” And then: “With no clear successor, the president stands at the beginning of a new era of dominance.”
    My old friend Fareed Zakaria of CNN wrote almost rhapsodically about the implications of the 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, which ended last week: “This party congress made clear that [Xi] is no ordinary leader,” he wrote. “[His] grip on power [is] far more secure than [that of] his immediate predecessors . . . For the rest of his life, Xi and his ideas will dominate the Communist Party of China.”
    To the author of The Post-American World, the implications are clear. “These changes are . . . occurring against the backdrop of the total collapse of political and moral authority of the United States in the world,” Zakaria concluded. “China [has] signalled that it now sees itself as the world’s other superpower, positioning itself as the alternative, if not rival, to the United States.”
    This point was seemingly lost on President Trump, who on Wednesday tweeted that he had called President Xi “to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation”.
    Xi whizz! But wait a second. We’re supposed to be impressed that, to quote The Economist, Xi Jinping’s “grip on China is tighter than any leader’s since Mao”? Last time I checked — and I did so with the peerless historian of Communist China, Frank Dikotter — Mao was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions in a succession of Mao-made catastrophes: the 1949 revolution, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. If Mao is Xi’s model, China is more likely to become a vast North Korea than a post-American colossus.
    So let’s get three things straight about events in Beijing last week. First, the Mao part. Yes, Xi is the first leader since Mao to have his “thought” (sixiang) put into the Chinese constitution while he is still in office. Deng Xiaoping’s “theory” (lilun) was not inserted until after his death. Moreover, in China, “thought” ranks above “theory”.
    But what is Xi’s thought exactly? The relevant amendment to the constitution runs to nearly 3,000 words, but in essence it combines the familiar (“socialism with Chinese characteristics”, a euphemism for capitalism since 1982) with new themes introduced by Xi in the past five years: “the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation”, “green development”, anti-corruption and the party’s primacy over the military.
    There is not much here that is Maoist. Take this, for example: “We shall give play to the decisive role of market forces in resource allocation . . . advance extensive, multi-level and institutionalised development of consultative democracy . . . [and] enhance our country’s cultural soft power.” Replace the word “Chinese” with “Swedish” and it wouldn’t look out of place in a Scandinavian social democratic manifesto.
    Second, the politics. Is Xi now all-powerful? No. He is primus inter pares on the seven-member standing committee of the politburo. The new line-up of the committee announced last week confirmed this. Li Keqiang, the premier, remained, and Wang Yang and Han Zheng joined, despite — according to students of factions within the Communist Party — being associated with the former presidents Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin. Xi’s close ally Chen Min’er, whom some experts see as a potential successor, was not on the list. Perhaps this was because Xi intends to break with tradition by seeking an additional term after 2022; on the other hand, he respected the existing retirement rules by bidding farewell to anti-corruption “tsar” Wang Qishan.
    Third, we still don’t know what Xi will do with his enhanced, though not absolute, authority. Key appointments in economic policy and finance will not be announced until March. Maybe the long-awaited structural reforms and deleveraging will finally arrive next year. Or maybe the vested interests within the state-owned enterprises will once again stave off the day of reckoning.
    Two centuries ago, westerners were right that China was stagnating. The Chinese can be forgiven for thinking the same about America today. Yet it is far from clear to me that China in 2017 has anything like the vitality and potential of Britain or the US in 1817. Apart from anything else, what made the English-speaking world so dynamic in those days was its unparalleled economic and political liberty.
    Beginning in the late 1970s, China overcame centuries of stagnation precisely because Mao’s successors understood that they had to decentralise the People’s Republic, giving economic if not political power to the people. If western commentators are right, Xi Jinping wants to go in the opposite direction. If the Chinese are lucky, he will turn out to be an enlightened absolutist, like Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew. If they are unlucky, he will be just another emperor who fondly dreamt of controlling a fifth of humanity. Worst case — but also least likely — he’s Mao 2.0.
    Maybe, just maybe, the wonders of modern information technology can give totalitarianism a new lease of life, as the big Chinese tech companies Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent make available the personal data of all Chinese netizens to the party. And maybe, thanks to big data, economic planning can now work where previously it failed. But I wouldn’t bet on it. And, to judge by the amount of foreign investment wealthy Chinese are still making in spite of tightened capital controls, neither would they.

## 2011-05-05 Bangladesh Cinema: Decaying… or Rebirthing? - Forum, Daily Star

  Cultural globalisation may be leading to the rebirth of Bangladeshi cinema, opines ZAKIR HOSSAIN RAJU.


  PRITO REZA
  Many are worried. Many of us are worried about what is happening to Bangladesh cinema for some years now. More specifically, the worried ones among us freely discuss their disgust at the kind of films the Dhaka film industry produces. Whenever we happen to talk about our local films, we tend to share the thought that the industry produced next to nothing (that is, in aesthetic terms) and it is going to be ruined soon! So 'decay' is the popular term to denote our film industry nowadays even by media scholars and film critics. That is why, 'Bangla cinema' was termed as 'an industry in decay' when Kajalie Shehreen Islam wrote a piece for The Daily Star special issue on its 12th anniversary in May 2008. More recently, Iftekhar Ahmed wrote a long piece in First News (24 October 2010). He echoed the views of Kajalie Islam when he concluded: 'Bangladeshi cinema is passing through a crisis. … [It] has gone backwards and its productions have declined in quality.'1

  I, of course, hold a different view about the turn of the Dhaka film industry. To say that the industry is going to decay means to me that we are unable to draw the larger context of media production and consumption and how the local cinema is a part of that. Actually most of us tend to look at Bangladesh cinema only as a cinema that is destined to serve only the population within the geopolitical territory that we call Bangladesh. This essay, by analysing the importance of the recent cinematic movements between Bangladesh and India, is one of the first attempts to look at the transnational dimensions of the 'national cinema' of/in Bangladesh. My point is: even the Asian film industries based on a vernacular language and with a large 'captive' audience tied to the vernacular (as it is the case for Bangladesh and West Bengal cinemas) are 'transnational' media industries. This cinematic flow can be seen as an oppositional symptom to the decay of Dhaka film industry. The possibility of Bangladesh cinema being and becoming a transnational media industry can actually lead to the rebirth of the industry.

  First, what do I mean by the 'larger context' for Bangladesh cinema? Primarily, our media as well as cinema shares a common South Asian mediascape (borrowing Arjun Appadurai's term). Bangladeshi cinema along with other South Asian cinemas is serving both as a carrier of national culture and as a globalising agent. The screen media, especially the film industries of/in South Asia are key sites where the local, the global and the transnational intersect each other.

  Within this context, I locate a slow and silent attempt of rebirth of Bangladesh cinema. This is happening through a partial encroachment by Dhaka cinema of the audiences from the other Bengali language film industry, that is West-Bengali cinema produced and circulated from the better known Bengali 'media capital': Calcutta. Why and how is that happening? Before going to that, a bit of history.


  PRITO REZA
  The tale of two Bengali film industries
  Since the 1960s, both the Bengali-language film industries based in Dhaka and Calcutta targeted a distinct population, a Bengali-speaking audience within their national or regional boundaries and rarely beyond that. Such a linguistically-defined viewing context coupled with 'captive' audiences for Bengali-language popular films ensured that Bengali film industries continued to survive as those rare species of medium-sized, vernacular film industries amid the globalising forces. Therefore, these two Bengali cinemas manage to survive, almost ignoring the Hollywood film industry, considered as a major threat to many film industries in the world. This success lies in the fact that the two cinemas addresswell-identified market sector, a non-English-speaking national/sub-national audience that is, Bengali-speaking Bengali Muslims in postcolonial Bangladesh and Bengali Hindus of West Bengal and Eastern India. In other words, the two Bengali cinemas somewhat divided the Bengali population in terms of their national and religious orientations and their films represent these biases in creating a particular spectatorship though sharing a common language. To put it in local terms: Dhaka industry focused on producing films for Bangals while Calcutta cinema attempted capturing whom we (the Bangals) call the Ghotis.

  Despite being the base for renowned Indian art cinema by filmmakers like Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak, the Bengali cinema of Calcutta retained its somewhat communalist characteristics. This cinema still serves the Bengali-Hindu audiences of West Bengal and neighbouring states in Eastern India. The so-called 'Golden Period' of this film industry ended in the 1960s. Shomeswar Bhowmik pointed out that during late-1960s the annual average production of Calcutta film industry came down to 28 films from 52 films per year produced in the mid-1950s.2

  On the other hand, the Dhaka film industry came into being as a full-fledged production industry only in the 1960s. The first feature film production in Dhaka happened in 1955, more than three decades later Calcutta and other Indian film centres started producing feature films. Its rise as a Bengali film industry coupled with the ban on theatrical exhibition of Indian films in East Pakistan decreed during 1965 India-Pakistan war have also contributed in declining Bengali film production in Calcutta in the 1960s and onwards.

  In the first decade of Dhaka film industry, that is between 1966-1975, it produced on average 28 films each year, the same number of films produced by Calcutta in the late-1960s. However, since 1976, the Dhaka industry has seen a dramatic increase in the number of films produced annually. During 1976-83, it produced on average 42 films each year including 50 films in 1979. This number has gone up to on average 67 films each year during 1984-1992. In the next eight years, during 1996-2003, Dhaka film industry produced on average 80 feature films annually.3 In other words, since the mid-1970s, the annual film production in Dhaka industry has increased at a rate of 25-30% in every five years or so while the Calcutta industry saw a sharp decline in the number of productions since the 1960s. While Calcutta film industry produced 46 films per year in the 1950s, this number decreased by 35% in the 1960s-1980s and went down to yearly 30 films or less4. In this way, by the 1980s Bangladesh popular film industry turned to be the larger and stronger Bengali-language film industry in contemporary South Asia.

  'Bangal films for Ghoti audience': A free flow of Bengali cinema in contemporary South Asia?
  Calcutta and Dhaka have 'always shared a love-hate relationship'5. Among other things, this is also reflected in calling each other Bangals and Ghotis! Within such a relationship, cinematic travel happened almost as one-way traffic, that is, Ghoti films for Bangal audience. For example, the first film screening that happened in Dhaka in 1898 in the then East Bengal was organised by a group of film exhibitionists who went down from Calcutta. Both Hindi and (Calcutta-produced) Bengali films, most of which are melodramas depicting Bengali Hindu lives, have been exhibited in East Bengali film theatres until the 1960s. For example, the Uttam-Suchitra cycle of Bengali melodramatic films of the 1950s-60s produced in Calcutta, was and is very popular among the Muslim middle class in East Bengal (now Bangladesh). These films are the foremost examples of melodramatising Bengali lives even for Muslim Bengalis and thus enveloped the communal barrier between Hindu and Muslim audiences in both parts of Bengal at least partially during mid- to late-twentieth century. Especially the availability of consumer VCRs since the early 1980s made circulation of videotaped West-Bengali as well as Hindi film melodramas among Bangladeshi audiences much easier. These West-Bengali film melodramas have been seen as ideals for the romance and family drama genres in Bangladesh cinema in the 1960s-90s. Though Bangladesh cinema appropriated and localised film plots and other elements from Calcutta cinema since film production began in Dhaka in the 1950s, the film industry in Dhaka somewhat positioned itself as the base for a Bengali-Muslim cinema from the 1960s onwards.6

  But that did not mean an end of cultural hegemony of Calcutta over the Dhaka middle class. As a teenager, I grew up in the Dhaka of 1980s. At that period Dhaka was much more provincial, and especially the cultural environment we experienced was largely dependent on all things Calcuttan. In the 1970s when most of the Dhaka middle class did not have a TV at home, we used to listen to the weekly radio drama from Akash Bani Calcutta. And of course, we received a regular diet of literary supplements from Calcutta too: starting with Leela Majumder, Sunil Ganguly and Satyajit Ray, we voraciously read the pulp fictions of Nihar Ranjan and Falguni Mukherjee as well as the 'high-brow' novels of Bimol Mitra, Shankar, Shirshendu and Shamaresh Majumder. In the film arena, we not only watched the works of three great Bengali filmmakers (Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen) with great enthusiasm, but films by lesser known West-Bengali talents also received much admiration from us. We appreciated our local authors or filmmakers very little (it probably did not improve a lot even during last few decades). And to tell the truth, we developed an impression that our local talents are not of 'high standard'! Why and how did we receive such a 'wisdom' that many of us still believe in? This is not the right place to enumerate all those historical journeys and political mishaps in the last one century or so that transformed the fate of our (un)divided Bengal(s) for good.

  The idea that Calcutta is the 'cultural capital' of Bengali-speaking people around the world is still strong among many of our minds, both from West Bengal and Bangladesh. Starting with the prose pieces by great reformist-authors of the 19th century Calcutta, we, the 'less-modern' populations of riverine, rural East Bengal have always imported the cultural products from Calcutta, a process that apparently geared the cultural modernisation of East Bengali Muslims during the last 100 years or so. However, the cultural hegemony of Calcutta over East Bengal/Bangladesh is no more intact. The fissures and gaps in such hegemony are visible in different forms in local media productions that many of us probably do not notice.

  As part of the globalising South Asian mediascape, the Dhaka media are coming of age at last and Calcutta is no more the only media capital for Bengali-language people around the world. Within such global/local interface, in recent years an opposite cultural flow (that is travel of Bengali cinema from Dhaka to Calcutta) is taking place. Since the early 1990s, starting with Beder Meye Josna (Josna, the daughter of a snake-charmer), Dhaka-produced popular films are being remade for the West-Bengali audience. Though there is no empirical study available, approximately 40-50 Bangladeshi popular films have been remade in Calcutta film industry for Indian, Bengali-Hindu audiences. This remaking of Dhaka films in Calcutta happened during 1991-2006 mostly, and if each year there were three or four films remade, that means at least 10% of West-Bengali films were remade upon recent Bangladeshi films.

  This phenomenon of remaking Bangal films for Ghoti audience is significant on a number of counts. Primarily this opposite flow signifies a certain level of freedom -- at political and economic levels, for both the Bengali-language film industries. In the 1990s-2000s, both film industries, as popular-cultural institutions are negotiating their roles and functions with globalising forces and nationalist discourses. The survival and expansion of both these cinemas lie on their partly-conflicting and partly-dialogic relationship with the postcolonial nation-states and their captive audiences who are greatly affected by the globalisation of media and economy. The travel of popular films from Dhaka to Calcutta proves how globalisation affected and transformed the older transactions between the two Bengali-language popular film industries in the world. Here cultural globalisation seems to be more powerful than cultural hegemony, and this scenario can only push Bangladesh cinema to go further in the global media playground. This kind of transnationalisation efforts can signal a rebirth for Bangladesh cinema in the coming years. So, stay tuned!

 ## 2011-11-05 Film policy in Bangladesh: The Road to Reform
    CATHERINE MASUD discusses the dying film industry and the need and ways in
    which to revive it.
    During the past one year, Tareque and I had begun to seriously reevaluate the path that we were taking as filmmakers. All around us were signs that the crisis in the film industry had reached a critical phase, and it no longer seemed worthwhile to make films in a country completely lacking in any coherent film policy. We began to research the reasons for the crisis and possible solutions, and this paper is a synthesis of many of our findings. I dedicate it to Tareque's and Mishuk's memory: they who had dedicated their lives to cinema, had dreamt great dreams of cinema, and had died together as they were embarking on yet another odyssey for the sake of cinema.
    Zahedul I Khan
    Over the years, there was so much that we shared together, and so much that we all struggled to change and achieve. In earlier times, much of the challenge we saw before us concerned embarking on and completing one film project or the other. But more recently we came to see that what we were doing was a futile exercise unless certain structural problems were addressed that concerned everyone living and breathing this art form that we call cinema. And what a peculiar art form it is, built from a succession of individual static frames, that through persistence of vision the human mind interprets as motion. These deceptively simple moving images, through an incredibly involved technological and creative process, are formed together to tell a story. So many talents must come together to properly utilise the potential of this art form -- good writing and storytelling skills, a strong sense of rhythm and music, an exceptional ability to visualise, a firm grasp of technology, a strong understanding of acting and the handling of artists, supreme managerial skills, not to mention, in the case of Bangladesh, endless patience and drive to overcome an absurd degree of political, bureaucratic and logistical obstacles. And this is just the filmmaking side of it. The other side is the tremendous effort and drive that are required to bring our films to our audiences -- after all, cinema is a mass medium, and what is the point of our art, unless we can reach out to the people for whom it was intended?

    Film is also the only art form that requires a massive infrastructure and industry behind it, to generate it, and an industry before it, to reach out to its mass audience. Production on the one hand, and distribution and exhibition on the other. In Bangladesh, however, film is neither art, nor industry.

    In Bangladesh, film is the nomoshudro of the arts. It is the lowest on the totem pole in a status conscious society. All the other major arts -- theatre, music, painting, literature -- have a national centre, film has none. Film is the artistic profession that no 'bhodro' family would tolerate their children entering. Hence the expression, 'filmer liney namsey' -- they came down to the film profession. Perhaps appropriately then, film is under the Information Ministry, rather than the Cultural Ministry, subject to draconian censorship policies and controls. It is viewed as a prosaic and factual means of transmitting propaganda on the one hand, and as a crude exercise in blood-and-guts-song-and-dance entertainment on the other. Only occasionally is there a breakthrough, an exception, to remind us that film is also art, but that is rare. As a nomoshudro art, retired films even have no proper burial ground. The National Film Archives, which I have elsewhere referred to as “The Killing Fields of Cinema”, has been in a permanent state of dislocation and mismanagement for the past 30 years. Through it, innumerable historic films and related materials have been lost or destroyed. Until the Film Archives has a proper permanent home, with proper facilities, it is no place to preserve your irreplaceable original works.


    Zahedul I Khan
    As for the industry, whether on the production side of the Film Development Corporation, otherwise knows as FDC, or the exhibition side of the cinema halls, counter-productive and backward policies have led to their near collapse.

    The situation for independent films is hardly better. Lack of proper local facilities force filmmakers concerned about quality to battle red tape to get their films processed in expensive facilities abroad. Once they return, they have to face the reality of having only a small handful of decent theatres to screen their films to their largely middle class audiences, mostly limited to the capital city. This is inevitably followed by a television premiere that is so crammed with advertising that no one has the patience or concentration to watch it.

    In order to better understand the reasons behind the crisis of cinema in Bangladesh, we need to first take a closer look at the state of the industry today with a historical view to the genesis of this collapse. Why is it that Film Development Corporation (FDC), with its huge government investment in facilities, credit-based subsidies to commercial filmmakers and protectionist policies that keep Hindi cinema at bay at least from the theatres, unable to produce good quality entertainment? In recent times, one actor, Sakib Khan, was temporarily able to attract audiences to the halls again; but even audiences tired of him after the endless stream of repetitive trash emanating from FDC. Not only in terms of quality, but also quantity, FDC is failing fast. Twenty years ago, on average 80-100 films were produced per year, far ahead of Pakistan or any other country in the region except India. Today, that number is down to 30-40 films per year. Many of these films aren't even shot on 35mm, they're shot on digital video, and then crudely transferred to 35mm for release. The vast majority of “commercial” films are box office flops, hence the desperate practice of splicing pornographic “cut pieces” into FDC films. FDC, saddled with massive corruption and mismanagement, will never be able to pull itself out of this downward spiral on its own; rather it will take a thorough review of the policies of subsidy and protectionism to force any real change. Interestingly, when we look back to the early 1960's, a time when not only did the local industry have to compete with Bollywood, but also Hollywood, Kolkata's Tollywood and Urdu-language films from West Pakistan, the local industry was producing far better films. Clearly protectionism is not helping the industry to survive. Also not helping is the fact that there is little profit incentive in the first place for these so-called commercial films, as they are largely made with black money seeking to be white, using a corrupt “credit” system that rarely gets repaid.


    Prito Reza
    Let's take a moment to consider the independent production sector, outside of FDC. The more recent rise in these films, produced by television or otherwise, has been a positive trend. These films can hardly benefit from the credit-based services of FDC, since they are largely made outside that system by more quality-conscious filmmakers. Costs are therefore higher, particularly since laboratory services must be sought outside the country. The profit incentive is therefore also stronger, but unfortunately, there is little chance of profit given the limitations of the exhibition sector, as I outline below. Most releases are only done in a handful of halls, and then immediately given a television “premiere”, to ensure a quick return. However, with this kind of release, there is a natural budget barrier for any producer who is concerned with getting a return on their investment. Filmmakers who go for higher budgets are either half-mad or have financing in the form of grants or black money that make the investment worthwhile. The only other way to circumvent this “budget barrier” is to go for a parallel release outside the mainstream cinema hall system. This is our experience with Muktir Gaan, and more recently Runway. In this scenario, producers become their own distributors and exhibitors, printing their own posters, tickets, and banners, publicising through the newspapers and television as well as through online networks like Facebook, hiring alternative halls and projection equipment, travelling around the country and running the shows directly themselves. The chance to directly interact with one's audience is an incredibly rewarding experience, and certainly the returns are potentially much higher, but it is also incredibly exhausting and time-consuming for filmmakers who could be expending their energies on their next film.

    On the exhibition side of the industry, the situation is equally, if not more dire. Out of the approximately 1,500 cinema halls that were in existence at the time of Liberation, only 500-600 remain. Most of these are in a terribly dilapidated condition, with tin roofs, wooden benches and mud floors. The projectors, locally made, leave costly film prints in shreds after a week of projection. Screens, usually made of painted jute or cheap white cloth, are caked with decades of dirt and grime. The light from the projectors is so weak that the image on the dirty screen is no more than a dim shadow. The sound, already poor quality due to the FDC dubbing, is so distorted in the hall sound system that human voices sound like crows. The 70-80 halls that are slightly better are only marginally so, with chairs instead of benches and concrete walls and ceilings. Out of these 20-30 are of a minimum middle class standard, and of these again there are only a handful that have high quality projection and air conditioning. Contrary to the global trend of 'multiplexes' -- modern halls equipped with two or more screens catering to middle class audiences -- Dhaka to date has only one multiplex theatre. Huge areas of the city, well-heeled areas such as Gulshan, Banani, Uttara and Dhanmondi, have no cinema halls at all. It's no wonder that the middle class, once the backbone of the audience, has long since deserted the theatres.

    It is important to note here that cinema halls are the front end of the industry, the stores where our goods are sold. The collapse of the halls would immediately backward link to generate the total collapse of the production and distribution sectors. The halls are the industry's most important physical asset. It is the part of the industry that directly concerns the people as well as the government. To save the industry the cinema halls need to be saved: they are the immovable infrastructure of the industry.


    Prito Reza
    Right now, halls are closing down on almost a weekly basis around the country. During our country-wide release of Runway, we had direct exposure to this reality, Since December of last year, Tareque extensively documented the closure or impending closure of dozens of halls in different districts. In interviews with hall owners, employees and audience members, a clear picture began to emerge that reinforced what we already knew theoretically. If one were to place the blame merely on the poor quality and low quantity of films being generated on the production side, inside or outside of FDC, that would only be part of the explanation. There are other, essentially structural issues that have doomed the halls to oblivion. An exorbitant ticket tax of 150%, dating back to the British period, has been the first barrier to growth in the exhibition sector. Despite an attempt to revive the industry by reducing this tax in the late 1990's from 150% to 100%, it remains one of the highest cinema taxation rates in the world. Consequently there is little left from the sale of tickets to go back to the halls for reinvestment, or to the producers and distributors to cover their expenses, not to mention generate a profit. Furthermore, halls outside of Dhaka are forced to pay distributors an advance “minimum guarantee” or MG, a flat rental fee for any film they want to run. The producers and distributors logic for the MG is that ticket sales are too difficult to track due to complicated and corrupt accounting practices. But the MG system further depresses the sector, and discourages smaller halls from taking better films with higher rentals in favour of the lowest quality cheaper ones. Meanwhile, due to a policy dating back to the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, Indian films are not allowed to run in Bangladeshi halls. Although originally motivated on political grounds, after 1971 the so-called economic logic of protecting the local industry has meant that the practice has persisted until today. No doubt noble in intention, this policy is ultimately destructive in that Hindi films are everywhere anyway, whether on DVDs, satellite channels, computers or even cell phones. Next to any cinema hall you will find a CD shop where all the big hits of Hindi cinema can be bought for the price of a hall ticket. Not only are cinema halls being deprived of potential block busters that could allow them to revive and reinvest, the government is being deprived of huge revenue. If there were an adequate supply of good local films to ensure the survival of the cinema halls, this would of course not be such an issue; however, as we've already seen, this is hardly the case.

    Now, you may ask, why should we care? If the films are so bad anyway, if FDC is collapsing along with the cinema halls, if independent films are a doomed enterprise, what does it matter? Perhaps we should let it die, and just move on to making films with our digital cameras and cell phones, uploading them on You Tube. But there is a bigger picture here to consider. Firstly, the fact remains that despite its shortcomings, the film industry provides a livelihood for millions of people, both directly employed in the production and exhibition sectors, and indirectly employed in related businesses such as the thousands of small businesses that thrive next to cinema halls. In a country of Bangladesh's population, with a still considerable film-related infrastructure, it is a potentially huge economic sector. Secondly, in any country, and Bangladesh more than many, film provides essential entertainment for an otherwise entertainment-deprived people, particularly outside the capital and in economically depressed regions. But film is not merely important for its entertainment value: film also contributes to social and political stability by giving people, particularly frustrated youth, an outlet for spending leisure time, away from political agitation, drugs, eve-teasing and other anti-social activities. It is interesting to note here that after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, it was the Iranian Government that took the initiative to build an additional 500 cinema halls around the country, in the interest of ensuring greater stability. Film also has a far-reaching significance in the society at large: when cinema culture is healthy and family-centred, it can provide a means of preserving and sustaining cultural traditions, positive societal values and national identity. One wonders the role that Bollywood cinema has played over the decades in forging a sense of national identity in an otherwise factionalised society like India's, with innumerable distinct local languages, ethnic origins and traditions. We should also be reminded that the powerful medium of film can be an effective vehicle for positive social change in a society, exposing injustice, encouraging tolerance, and celebrating diversity. And last but not least, cinema can potentially provide huge revenue streams for the government once it is properly revived.

    But how to revive the industry, when it is already almost dead? Even if we all agreed that it needed to be revived, where would we get the economic planning and know how to do so? Interestingly enough, there are many precedents in the region that can serve as models. In fact, Bangladesh lags behind as the ONLY country in South Asia that has not initiated major reforms in the industry in recent times. Let's start with our biggest neighbour, India. Up until 10 years ago, the entertainment tax was 150% of the ticket cost in many states, again a legacy of the British era when theatre and cinema were considered to be best relegated to an elite pastime. Complicated licensing laws for cinemas dating back to 1918 made it a lengthy and costly process to establish new halls, much like the current situation in Bangladesh. Films were financed mainly by mafia or other black money sources, with poor returns to producers and distributors due to disorganised, corrupt and difficult-to-track accounting practices, again a familiar scenario. Given this situation, from the 1980s onwards, cinema halls around the country were losing business and closing down. Occasional “hits” would lead to temporary upswings and some hall renovations, only to be followed by long stretches of dismal business.

    This all changed in 2001. Due to increasing pressure from various stakeholders, film was given official industry status by the government, thus entitling film-related enterprises and establishments to special tax breaks and simplified bureaucratic procedures, and making the industry an attractive investment for banks and corporate entities. Mafia and black money began to retreat. In addition, the Indian government, recognising the critical role of cinema halls in reviving the industry, introduced a 4-5 year “tax holiday” (tax exempt status) for entrepreneurs to establish new multiplexes. Other tax incentives, such as reduced utilities and land taxes, were also introduced. Overall, there was a reduction in the ticket tax to an average of 30-45%, even less in some states such as Tamil Nadu, at 15%. At the state level, special policies were introduced to promote regional language films, such as in West Bengal, where Hindi films are heavily taxed to subsidise the local industry, while local films are barely taxed at all.

    Within a few years, dramatic results began to be seen. Firstly, there was a dramatic growth in multiplexes throughout the country, targeting young, urban, upwardly mobile audiences.

    By 2010 there were over 700 muliplex screens nationwide. Though only accounting for roughly 5% of India's 13,000 screens, they brought in 30-35% of the total box office sales. Multiplexes also ushered in a shift to new, digital forms of projection (the high-end version, closest to cinema quality, is 2K). This reduced print costs for producers and distributors, and enabled simultaneous release over many more theatres, thus reducing piracy. Electronic ticketing, a Multiplex hallmark, also simplified the accounting process and ensured proper returns. The Muliplex format, with its more sophisticated audiences and better returns, also encouraged higher quality, better-scripted films, and more experimentation with styles and genres. “Multiplex film” became a marketing category. Multiplexes also drove huge increases in consumer spending through affiliated shopping malls and restaurants. Although not initially given tax concessions, single screen cinemas, catering to more general audiences, were later also offered tax breaks to upgrade facilities or subdivide their theatres into two or more screens. Overall, these policies led to a renaissance of the Indian film industry over the last 10 years, with more and better films being produced for larger audiences and bigger profits. What's more, Multiplex films were also ideal fare for the economically powerful legions of Indians settled abroad, and foreign sales of Indian films become an increasingly important source of revenue.

    But India was not the only country initiating reforms. Pakistan's industry, which had seen its Golden Age of Cinema in the 1960s and 70s, was in a total state of collapse at the turn of the millennium. In 1990 there had been 750 theatres around the country; in 2002 the number had shrunk to 175. In the late 1990s an attempt was made to salvage the industry by reducing the entertainment ticket tax from 150% to 65%. Tax incentives were introduced to encourage multiplexes, and in 2002 the first multiplex opened in Karachi, with a dozen more quickly following. In 2004, cinema halls were completely exempted from paying any entertainment tax until 2009, and this policy has been extended in many states including Punjab. Most remarkably, in 2008, the decades-old ban on Indian films, also dating from 1965, was completely withdrawn. The same year the Pakistani hit film Khude Ki Liya was released widely throughout India on over 100 screens.

    In Sri Lanka in 2007 a series of major reforms were proposed in the 2007 budget. The primary reform was a tax holiday of 10 years for newly constructed cinema halls using modern equipment approved according to prescribed guidelines. In addition, a 5-year tax holiday was granted for existing cinemas that upgraded their facilities along the same guidelines. To give further incentives, a package of tax reductions and exemptions was introduced at the production, distribution and exhibition levels for such things as laboratory charges, import of equipment, utilities costs and other services. To ensure the financial stability of the industry, higher taxes were levied not only on imported films, but also on imported tele-dramas and advertisements. The revenue from these taxes is being used for reinvestment in the local industry, including a new Film City and Training Institute. Even Nepal, with its tiny local industry, has also introduced reforms, including incentives for new multiplexes with digital projection technology, and a two-tier taxation rate, with Hindi and other foreign films taxed at 25% while local films are only taxed at 13%. Kathmandu, with a population of less than one million (as compared to Dhaka's staggering 15 million), already has eight modern multiplexes, with another 19 new halls under construction.

    So, it seems the road to reform is not so distant after all, with so many successful models near at hand to follow. The formula is fairly straightforward: revive the film industry by targeting the exhibition sector. Introduce a package of tax incentives and reforms to promote the growth of new modern cinema halls and upgrading of old facilities. Introduce more competition, but tax foreign films heavily and reduce the local entertainment tax to subsidise reinvestment in the sector. More specifically, a package of proposals for reform of the cinema hall sector could be as follows:

    1. Tax holiday of at least five years for new multiplexes with modern equipment, facilities and ticketing system.

    2. Tax holiday of at least three years for renovation of existing halls (must include specified upgrades of projection & sound equip, and facilities improvement)

    3. Specially reduced land/facilities/electricity tax rates for cinema halls to encourage preservation of existing halls and establishment of new ones.

    4. Promotion of introduction of digital projection (should be specified as 2K) and surround-sound. This should follow the standard international configuration for digital theatres.

    5. Facilitate controlled importation of foreign films, with high taxation rate to subsidise a low tax policy for local films. Initiate a bilateral policy agreement for Indo-Bangladesh film exchange.

    6. Tax concessions on import of projection and sound system equipment

    7. Simplification of licensing and permits for new halls to speed establishment. Additional incentives for halls outside Dhaka metro area to encourage cinema hall networks in smaller cities and towns.

    8. Reduction in the overall ceiling for the entertainment ticket tax with a two-tier system to promote national cinema (i.e. 10% for local films, 50% for foreign films).

    9. The reduction in the tax burden should be reflected in fixed reduction in ticket prices to give added audience incentive. Also fix increased percentages to be allotted for Exhibitors as well as for Producers and Distributors on a fair and equitable basis.

    As in other countries in the region, these reforms should have a positive impact on the entire industry through backward linkage to the distribution and production sectors. Film producers, long starved of proper venues to show their films, will invest more money in more films to meet the demands of a growing, more middle-class audience. Distribution companies will also be revived to meet the demands of producers who need intermediaries to market and disseminate their productions. And filmmakers will be inspired to make better films with better budgets. But it is just a beginningthere are so many reforms that will remain, of the functioning and role of FDC, of the Censor Board, and of the film-related government bureaucracy. Of course, the real start, is to begin to dream, and to share our dreams with the public, so that together we can move forward towards a revitalised film industry in Bangladesh.

  End of show for movie theatres?
  With nearly two-thirds of Bangladesh's cinema halls already shut and more likely to follow the suit, Mamunur Rashid and Ashik Hossain peep behind the screen to find the cause
  Mamunur Rashid and Ashik Hossain
  bdnews24.com Correspondents
  Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Nearly two-thirds of Bangladesh's movie theatres have closed down over the last 10 years and many others are facing the same risk as most hall owners are opting to shift to the comparably profitable super market business.
  Owners have dubbed continuous losses, extortion, exorbitant taxation on ticket prices, and lack of administrative support and 'quality' cinema as the key reasons forcing them to change their trade.
  "No one is interested in holding onto a trade that has to be fed from his own pockets. We tried a lot to make it sustain…but it is not possible," Bangladesh Film Distributors' Association chief Firoz Rashid told bdnews24.com.
  The largest movie theatre in the country, Jessore's Monihar, was declared shut 'indefinitely' on July 21.
  The whys
  "The owners were forced into the move due to continuous extortion, terrorist attacks and life threats," the theatre's Manager, Shamim Ahmed, told bdnews24.com.
  He, however, added that they did have plans to reopen the venue that once hosted 1,430 film enthusiasts in a go.
  Information Minister Abul Kalam Azad on June 28 expressed his concern over the shutdowns in the parliament.
  "750 of the 1200 licensed cinema halls have already shut down. The owners are turning to more profitable businesses and tearing down the halls and replacing them with multi-storied commercial buildings."
  Azad also blamed the closures on the ease with which people could now view satellite channels.
  'Lack of Quality Film'
  However, the distributors' platform chief differed with the minister and said lack of 'quality' films should in fact be blamed.
  "Earlier, there would be over a 100 new releases each year. Now it's not even 25, and we are forced to choose from them as not all of them are hits. In many cases, we have to repeatedly screen the same movie," Rashid pointed out.
  "On the other hand, there are no new faces on the silver screen ... people are tired of seeing Shakib Khan and Apu Biswas over and over again."
  He added: "This is why we wanted permission to screen Indian films. After getting the approval, we also advanced a lot of money to book cinemas. However, the arts arena protested the move."
  "They should also understand that you cannot live on talks alone. If we do not screen movies, how are we going to earn our bread or run the halls?"
  Continuous losses
  Sorowar Morshed, who owned Rajshahi's now-closed Lily and Bornali movie theatres, claimed, "The business does not bring returns. There is no audience. I had no option other than shutting those down after losing Tk 0.6 million over the last few years."
  He also advocated for screening foreign films.
  "At one time, Bengali, English and Urdu films were screened together. It was not a problem then."
  "The quality, making and stories of our films are very low standard. And since the market is not competitive, the producers-directors do not have the drive to improve standards."
  Morshed continued that if the people had more options, they would be more selective and the makers would be forced to improve.
  When asked what was being built at the sites of his two movie theatres, he said he had sold off the property.
  Apart from Lily and Bornali, five of six cinema halls were shut down in Rajshahi over the decade.
  Lack of administrative support
  Complications relating to the local administration saw North Bengal's oldest movie theatre, Rangpur's Lakkhi Talkies, not operating for the last two years.
  The district administration shut down the cinema hall, with accommodation for 850 viewers, on Jan 12, 2010. The 73-year-old entertainment centre was once the main source of recreation for the masses of the area.
  "I was running the hall on lease from the district administration. However, they suddenly cancelled the lease. We tried our best to reopen the hall but they did not help us," alleged Shafiqul Islam, proprietor of the cinema hall.
  "There are screening equipment worth hundreds of millions of Taka in the hall which they are not returning to us. Equipment worth Tk 100 million have been already lost."
  He added that his sources in the administration said that the property might be given to a developer. "If that happens, then a super market or an apartment complex might be built after tearing down the cinema hall."
  Islam added that a case between the district administration and him is currently pending at the High Court.
  Meanwhile, Fahmidul Haq, an Associate Professor of Dhaka University's Mass Communication Department and film critic, viewed the situation in a different light.
  "Most cinema halls no longer have the suitable environment for cinema viewing. Even those which have, their entry costs are too high. If taxes on hall tickets are lowered, then their prices can be lowered."
  "There is a 150 percent tax on each ticket in Bangladesh, which is the highest in the world," Haq pointed out.
  The bow-outs
  Dhaka itself once had 44 cinema halls, Chairman of Film Directors Association Mohammad Hannan pointed out. "Not even 20 are in operation now."
  He continued that Bangladesh's oldest movie theatre New Picture House, which had seen a number of owner changes since its establishment during the First World War, was last called Shabistan when it was torn down to be replaced by a modern apartment and shopping complex.
  The cinema hall, which initially screened silent films, was the centre of recreation for Dhaka residents at one time. No steps were taken to preserve the historic theatre.
  Gulshan's Jyoti Cinema Hall, Elephant Road's Mallika Hall, Sadarghat's Rupmahal, Nababganj's Tajmahal, Gulistan Cinema Hall, Waisghat's Moon Cinema Hall, and Old Dhaka's Lion Cinema Hall and Diamond Theatres stand shut now.
  Johnson Road's historic Azad Cinema Hall, which hosted the first moving picture with sound, has also been torn down to be replaced with a commercial complex.
  Azad, which was initially established by Murapara's Jamindar Mukulchandra Bandopaddhay in 1928 and named Mukul, was renamed in the 60s. The special show of 'Mukh O Mukhosh' was held here on Aug 3, 1956.
  Mirpur's Beauty, Postogola's Meghna Cinema, Diana and Jamuna, Farmgate's Ananda Cinema, Waisghat's Star, Tikatuli's Obhishar, Shantinagar's Jonaki and Karwan Bazar's Purnima Cinema Hall were also shut down over the last decade.
  "Tongi's Anarkoli and Champakali Cinema Halls might close down any moment. Meanwhile, there are no cinema halls in Uttara, Uttar Khan or Dakkhin Khan. Other than the Sainik Club in Banani, there are no cinema halls in the whole Gulshan area," Hannan added.
  "Even though millions reside in these areas, there is no way to screen films. However, movies are still the only source of entertainment of the common people."
  The directors' platform stalwart also alleged that even though the administration was supposed to maintain the cinema halls, there was no initiative on its part.
 ## 2016-11-07 Pakistan:Are Indian movies important for our film industry's survival?
      HIP got in touch with the exhibitors a few weeks back, but this time we get in touch with people within the industry.

      Ever since we can remember, India and Pakistan have had a love-hate relationship. While we like to believe that the masses, of both indian and Pakistan, want to co-exist happily, the extremists groups ensure that the friendly relationship between the neighboring countries don't last long. We enjoyed the time when our artists were welcomed in India with open arms and vice versa, our drama serials - hand picked by Zee Network - were praised by the Indian masses, and we saw movies like Bajrangi Bhaijaan and PK being made in Bollywood and hailed in Pakistan.
      We also saw Indian veteran actors such as Om Puri and Naseeruddin Shah working in our movies. Mahesh Bhatt, who is all for peace between India and Pakistan, gave Meera, Atif Aslam and Imran Abbas a chance to showcase their talent in Bollywood. Karan Johar made Fawad Khan the superstar he is today by signing him for Kapoor & Sons. Even our cinema opened up to Indian movies and sometimes even preferred to allot more screens to them as compared to our own movies.
      But, as they say, nothing lasts forever and ever since the Uri attacks took place in September, situation between the two countries has escalated to extreme levels.
      With the MNS banning our artists from working in Bollywood and our exhibitors deciding to halt their films in return, we are left wondering if things will ever return to 'normalcy'?
      Emotions and nationalism are definitely running high on both sides of the border, but one question that haunts us when we think of our entertainment industry is:
      Can our multiplexes and cinemas survive without Bollywood given the limited number of films we produce per year?
      To get a clear picture, HIP got in touch with actors, directors and producers to ask if they thought Indian movies were essential for our industry's survival? Will it harm our cinemas' business? Will the lack of competition send us back to making mediocre film?

      HIP finds answers to all this and more.
      Ahmed Ali Butt (actor/host/musician)
      "If you ask me I feel that our film industry has just stood up on its feet and the main reason for that is foreign cinema. Whether it is indian movies or even Hollywood ones, the fact is, that we [Pakistani cinema] at the moment dont have the numbers to sustain the cinema industry so let's call a spade, a spade shall we?," Butt said truthfully.
      "We need foreign cinema at the moment whether we like it or not. There are several multiplexes opening this year alone and several are in construction. The demand is only going to grow as more and more people start going to cinemas again. I feel that we are definitely making better films day by day but we cannot match the numbers of the Indian or even the Hollywood films at the moment but Insha’Allah I’m very confident that one day we will."
      Shahzad Nasib (Tv/Movie Producer)
      Nasib feel that this is an old debate and we should first reach a stage where we're churning out good quality films at regular intervals before placing bans on foreign content.
      "Whatever the situation might be between the two countries, this issue always arises. In my opinion, problems should have permanent solutions, re-ignition of Indian content in Pakistan or vice versa or even exchange of artists between the two countries have always had strings attached in the form of criticism as we have not yet come to a definite solution," Nasib explained in detail and suggested to find a long term solution this time around instead of just sugar coating the issue. "There are many dimensions to this issue and every dimension has its own pros n cons. It's not mathematics that 2+2=4. We have to realize that millions of people on both sides of the border watch each other's content. Countries that fought world wars and killed millions of innocent civilians are now together sharing one currency due to their mutual interests."
      He added that he is not advocating any mitigation strategy or change of country's stance.
      "Like myself there are millions of common people, who have these questions in their minds. Fact of the matter is, how to support our cinemas at this stage? We don't have content as backup because many of our films/movies are not ready yet so cinema owners are in a fix over lack of options."
      According to him, channel owners are in a better position as compared to cinema owners because they have access to content which can replace Indian content, but exhibitos don't enjoy that luxury.
      "Private TV channels are a bit better placed as content is somehow available to them to be aired. I may not be wrong in saying that our media industry may take up to five years to achieve self-sustaining status especially in case of films. Our content is as good as anybody else's. All we need is to believe in ourselves and continue with the same zeal. We have to look into breeding grounds i.e. universities where media studies are being taught, encourage young blood, guide them, give them a chance and things will be much better in near future. In this way, our media industry will advance on a much faster pace."
      Aashir Azeem (Actor/Director/Writer)
      "For any film industry to survive, it is important to have a domestic market [unfortunately] which is not available to us at the moment. I am not in favor of the ban on Indian movies, but I would like to suggest a quota regime, which is happening all over the world. If a distributor distributes 10 foreign movies then three must be Pakistani," he gave a suggestion that hit home. "There will be negative repercussions initially as these new cinemas were made to cater a specific class which enjoys watching Indian movies. With that not being shown at the moment, cinema owners will find it difficult to survive"
      With that thought he was quick to add,
      "Our production will become better, not immediately mind you, but eventually. Another thing which I feel is important is that we should strike a balance so the cinema survives. As far as going back to making mediocre movies is concerned, I don’t think that will happen as the new breed of writers and directors are all educated and I am sure the standards they set will be high."
      Ahsan Rahim (Director)
      The celebrated ad maker, who himself just announced a feature film, believes that business will suffer because Bollywood has a huge demand in Pakistan due to various factors.
      "Indian movies brought people to the cinema so banning them would affect the business. Do keep in mind that whole infrastructure had collapsed and it took English and Indian movies to reconstruct it; plus the dynamics of cinema have also changed with the advent of multiplexes," Rahim explained. "We share a common language with Bollywood, but that said, Pakistani films can beat Indian movies in Pakistan any day. The only issue is that cinema is like a machine that needs a movie every two weeks and right now we are not meeting that number so the theaters will indeed suffer."
      While speaking on the issue if lack of competition will result in poorly made Pakistani films, Rahim said, "As far as making mediocre movies is concerned, I feel that our improvement isn't related to Indian cinema, but more visionary writers and directors."
      We agree with you there Ahsan Rahim!

      Nadeem Mandviwalla (Producer/Film Distributor)
      The owner of Karachi's Atrium cinema feels that the ban will not just impact business, but will also affect the content of our films.
      "Since 2007, Pakistan's cinema Industry is on a rebuilding spree and while at that time we were 100% dependent on imported films (Indian & American), after nine years of development we have come to a stage whereby we are now 50 to 70% dependent on it," Mandviwalla revealed the important figures. "So overall we still remain dependent and will have a 50 to 60% impact in monetary terms. Any vibrant industry needs good competition as it becomes the biggest incentive and challenge for improvement. If good films are not being shown in Cinemas whether from India or America then it will effect in the development and new investment in the cinema sector which will eventually limit the growth of film budgets. Thus, can cause a chain effect to mediocrity."
      Vasay Chaudhry (Writer/Actor/Hum Films GM content)
      The ace writer who gave us the biggest hit Jaawani Phir Nahi Aani had a very different take on the question.
      "One thing which you must see is that the situation is different from what it was in 1965, when the Indian films were first banned . At that time, cinema houses were already there, hence, we could make our own films [and earn] but this time around we have only 90 screens. If there won't be any cinemas then we won't even get the chance to make mediocre films! All I can say, is pray that the tradition of filmmaking doesn't die."

      Fakhar-e-Alam (Actor, Ex-Chairman of Sindh Censor Board)
      Fakhr-e-Alam took us back to the 70s and 80s and compared the current situation to the era gone by - the era which led to the doom of our cinema industry.
      "The ban on the Indian movies will have a major impact on the revenue intake of the exhibitors. Indian movies were banned in the 70s and 80s, but people who wanted to see it could easily watch it on CDs. Because of this, the Indian culture became a part of our culture," Alam said. "Once Indian movies were allowed, new age cinema screens started to build, people began to invest, and cinemas were constructed. And once you have invested 30 crores [in something] then you want people to come out and buy that ticket so the owners do not face a loss."
      He further made us realise how important Indian cinema is for our growth and sustenance.
      "The reality is that, Indian films bring in the revenue that gave people confidence to invest Rs 25-30 crores in a cinema/cineplex. And consequently, because of these screens, producers feel safe to invest Rs 6-7 crores in a movie. If you ask me, it is a matter of commerce and intelligence. If you really want to ban Indian content then ban it completely, we cannot be hypocrites about it."
      Fakhr-e-Alam, who was an integral part of our censor board until a few months ago, shared an interesting anecdote as well.
      "Let me share an incident with you. When Dhoom 3 was about to release, the Lahore High Court got a stay order against it, and in those three weeks, various owners of cinemas in Karachi called me to say how they had to shut two out of four screens as they weren’t making money because in a capacity of 200 people only 30-40 people were actually seated!"
      What's the solution? Should we be forever dependent on foreign content?
      "But if the ban is going to be permanent then government needs to come up with a local film policy where the industry is recognized. Funds should be set aside for filmmakers. Pakistan needs to make at least 45-50 movies in a year so every weekend we see a new movie and attract a large number of audiences. We are making movies with new filmmakers because of business opportunity as it’s a serious business. We need to make correct policies. It’s all about math and we have to be practical and not emotional about it."
      Beenish Waiz/ Umer Adil ( Producer and Director)
      The duo highlighted the short term advantages of the current suspension on Indian films and the long term disadvantages.
      "We believe that the producers who are going to be releasing their movies in the next few months are at an advantage as people will come out to see their movie since nothing else will be in the cinema. But in the long run it is not a good idea as it will reduce occupancy," they said. "A ban does not make a product vanish as those who want to see Indian movies will find a way to watch it, so you see people won't be effected only cinemas will be."
      "Our industry is in its initial stages and we believe art and culture should not be mixed.Our artists going there and them coming here was a positive growth. We enjoy a good film irrespective of where it is from and healthy competition is good for us. Since we at the moment can not churn out 50-60 movies in a year; the reality is that we are dependent on Bollywood."
      Nina Kashif (General Manager Urdu 1)
      "Definitely it [the ban] will have a negative impact on our industry because we do not produce as many films per year. We don't release a new movie every week. And cinema owners earn much more through Indian films than they do through ours," Kashif shared. "We can't afford to ban their movies at this point in time as we will suffer in the long run. As far as lack of competition is concerned, it wont send us back to making mediocre films as now we know what we want, and with every film we will only get better and better".
      Jeerjees Seja( CEO ARY Digital)
      ARY Films has churned out one successful film after another (case in point are JPNA, Ho Mann Jahaan, and Janaan) and if a man who's part of the successful production house says we need Indian films, then we ought to listen.
      "We are a industry, who is still in its initial stage, we can not make a new movie every week as filmmaking is time-consuming," Seja reiterated what others have said. "Competition of any kind is healthy and the most important thing to note is that if we make a good movie then viewers do come out to see it, but for us to be able to release movies every week we need to become a established industry and that can only happen with time."

      Najaf Bilgrami (Director/Cinematographer)
      Bilgrami feels the ban is a temporary move and will only have negative consequences.
      "Not allowing Indian movies to be shown in cinemas makes no difference as people will find an alternative to watch those films. They will purchase Dvds or simply download it," Bilgrami highlighted the harsh reality. "I think this is a temporary thing and if it is not, then definitely cinema owners will suffer, as they won't have enough releases to utilise their screens and eventually they'll have to shut down due to lack of audience."
      "I feel competition is healthy and is neccessary for growth. We need to up our game, see where the Indian movies lack, and use that to our advantage. We have amazing writers and talent. We just need to stick together, make unforgettable movies, and progress!"

      Yasir Nawaz (Director/Producer)
      The director, who's busy making his upcoming masala film, Mehrunisa V Lub U, called the ban downright ridiculous.
      "It makes no sense to ban Indian movies as I am sure cinema houses will again be showing them in a few years if not months, so to me, it seems a bit ridiculous. All of us grew up watching movies from across the border, but that did not make us Indian? It is just entertainment!" said a clarly exasperated filmmaker.
      He also pointed out the 'ugly' truth.
      "The truth is we don’t make enough movies in a year to sustain the industry because we work on limited budgets while Bollywood has huge budgets. I love my country but let's be logical. I say if you must boycott then ban it once and for all, but the issue is that our industry is still new so cinemas won't be able to survive and if they don't survive, how will we show our movies?"
      "In due time, I am sure we will be standing on our own feet and make ample of movies to satisfy the needs for our multiplexes and standalone cinemas."
      Mohsin Yaseen (GM Marketing Cinepax Cinemas)
      "As Pakistani films are not available in the required quantity, we are dependent on foreign content - Indian as well as English - for the growth of both our cinema and film industry as they go hand in hand. Currently, our cinema industry is in its infancy with only 85 screens available for 200 million plus population, so in our case, all the content from around the world is necessary to blossom our industry and films. It will help better our own content," Yaseen explained in detail the dynamics of our industry and how they'll be affected by lack of content.
      "Back in 2007, we saw a re-awakening of our film industry with one Pakistani release Khuda Kay liye in a year and now only in past 12 months we have released approximately 10 Pakistani films! Everyone is experimenting with genres and eventually we'll find our unique identity," said Yaseen.
      He also gave us the good news about how Cinepax plans to encourage all filmmakers to make more films by setting up a fund.
      "We as a cinema brand help and encourage all filmmakers to experiment. We have also launched a film fund which will help makers to complete their projects quickly as we need upto 40 to 50 Pakistani films a year in order to sustain. This whole process may take another four to five years, but this will act as a catalyst for the growth of our industry. Pakistan's film industry is the best too to project Pakistan's soft image across the globe."
      After conversing with a number of filmmakers, exhibitors, and producers, we can safely conclude that we need Bollywood to survive at the moment because we don't release enough films. A cinema needs a fresh release every week to survive and we don't see that happening in the near future. But, things are on the right track and as far as the belief that 'lack of competition may result in producing mediocre films' is concerned, it was turned down by everyone.

      With time, we may be able to sustain on our own films, but right now we need the Bollywood masala because, honestly, how many of you refrained from watching Ae Dil Hai Mushqil or reading its review just because it was an 'Indian' films? Every single one of us made an effort to watch it and that alone says a lot about the state of affairs in Pakistan.
