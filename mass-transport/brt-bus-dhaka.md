Main theme of the paper: show that competition hurts mass transportation and public take over is the only solution
Objective of writing the paper: It will help with the journal article


# Introduction 

## Background 

In the month of July, an unique movement started in the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh. In July, 2018  a bus killed two school children in a race to collect more passengers. These two kids died in the race of two buses to collect passengers and thus increase the day revenue. It brought down protests throughout the country and particularly in Dhaka, the school students took over the control of the streets replacing the traffic police. It created a great political upheaval in Bangladesh.  High school kids, secondary school kids came to streets protesting death of two of their friends.  This kids actually ruled the city for a few days, controlling traffics.

It was a common incident that Bus drivers are quite reckless. That was not the first time it happened. Frequently these city buses were involved in several accidents. People were already pissed off. Therefore, when kids got involved it became very sensitive.

With this background, we would like to investigate whether mass transportation, particularly Bus service is problematic or not. It is apparent this sector is quite competitive. There are quite a few actors in the market. Bus drivers compete with each other to pick up passengers and finish the trip earlier.

## Objective

It is usually expected that competition will bring about better service and quality in a market. In transportation sector in Bangladesh it seemed that competition brought about the worst possible outcome for transportation. This paper investigates the reasons behind this phenomenon. We found that this is actually a classic case of market failure since mass transportation is essentially a public good with externality effect. Therefore, market equilibrium resulted into socially inefficient outcome. A related  objective of this paper is to look into the economic incentive of Bus operators that lead to this stiff aggressively competitive behaviors which led to the tragic incident. We will look into the current employment structure which is actually determined by the whole mass transportation industry.


# Current situation in dhaka city 

## Description 
Bus, CNG-run auto-rickshaw and rickshaw are three mainstays of public transport in the capital. Bus and auto-rickshaw contribute to as many as 87.40 per cent of road transport communication in Dhaka while bus alone makes 72 per cent.[^jica]



## Mass transportation market situation

* No. of buses and routes

According to @anwar_palo_words_2018, BRTA data shows there are 3.30 million vehicles in the country. In the same vein, according to  BRTC, there are 35,000 buses and mini buses, half of which operate outside Dhaka.According to Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), a total of 7,937 bus and mini buses ply along 246 routes in Dhaka and its adjacent areas.

 There are no planned structure on which bus operator will maintain which route, there are no time schedule. * No. of owners
After the application for permission, traffic police, the opinions of bus owners-workers and the clout of the applicants are taken into consideration.

The route permission was given after setting certain conditions of the Motor Vehicle Act, without any consideration of passengersâ€™ route demands, population density or road capacity.




Many bus owners have one or two buses. Dhaka Metropolitan Regional Transport Committee gives permission for movement of the vehicles. The committee members include police and representatives from BRTA, different departments of the government and bus owners and workers. 


* No. of passengers serving

## Consequences

* Accidents

Unbridled competition has led to total chaos in this sector. This immensely affected the behaviour of drivers who are at the heart of maintaining safety on the road. The channel through which this drivers are affected is mainly their main source of livelihood, the salary earned from driving these buses. It is how their earning is determined will affect current state. Therefore the main focus of our discussion structure of the market that determines the incentive structure of the market. Due to unplanned and unnecessary routes and innumerable owners, the buses enter unhealthy competition. As there are many owners under the same company, the drivers of buses join in a competition as to who will pick up passengers first and this causes road accidents.

# Learning from other cities

The good thing here is that it is not unique. Many countries experienced the same and came over fixing the problem.

## Description of Cities 

### Delhi
* Past situation
* Measures taken

On the other hand Delhi has adopted the gross cost model, the operators are paid on KM operation not based on passenger carried. Thus revenue risk is under government. But the government can change the fare without consulting with operators. The operators are selected through competitive bidding process. As gross cost model does not eliminate all the risk like DIMTS developed performance management system. 



### Seoul
* Past situation 


Before the reform, bus services in Seoul were operated by a large number of private operators, with virtually no government control of routes, schedules, or other aspects of  service. There were high levels competition on the most profitable routes, and little or no 
interest in serving socially important, but less profitable routes. Most routes were planned to allow a maximum of passengers to be able to use the service but this made travel times  unnecessarily long as few buses took the most direct route to their destination. 
Unprofessional activities by bus drivers to attract passengers and stop and starts at bus stops often caused accidents or disrupted normal traffic. 

Bus companies engaged in competition for the most profitable routes and cancelled routes in unprofitable areas without warning with little or no consideration for passengers. Service levels fell and bus drivers would often squeeze as many passengers as possible onto the bus, drive recklessly, avoid picking up elderly or disabled passengers and at times simply not stop at some stops if it did not suit them. Despite the fact that bus business was declining, 
prospects of reform encountered strong resistance from the private bus operators and especially the drivers. Therefore, one of the most important tasks was to convince the bus drivers to support bus reform. 
 
All major bus routes were redesigned according to demand and to increase overall capacity. The routes were restructured to improve service levels with more regular frequencies and integrate better with the metro. A new numbering system was introduced and buses were grouped into easy-to-follow four color coded types.

# Conclusion

It has been found that all over the experience that mass transportation left it to the market creates inefficient results. In economics terms, mass transportation is a public good. If we leave a public good to the market, it is going to fail. Market failure happens in the case of a public good. That is what has happened here. From the examples above we find that most of big cities around the world implemented government directed system instead of leaving everything to the market. Therefore, it is high time that Dhaka also follow the same route.The economics of mass transport is not that straight forward. Obviously the competition breaks down, the market fails here. But the mechanics of why the mass transportation competition does not work is not readily understandable. There needs to be some theoretical work on it. Need to search along that line. That will be I think a real contribution. May the future work.
