বাংলাদেশে পেয়াঁজের দাম একদিনে শতকরা ৫০ ভাগ বেড়ে যায়। কারণ ভারত  পেয়াঁজ রপ্তানী বন্ধ করে দেয়। এর কারণ হলো সেখানে পেয়াঁজের ফলন ক্ষতিগ্রস্থ হয় এবং উৎপাদন ব্যাহত হয় অতিরিক্ত বৃষ্টির কারণে। 

গত ১৪ তারিখে ভারত রপ্তানী বন্ধের ঘোষণা দেয়। এ বছরের শুরুতে পেয়াঁজের দাম ছিল ৩০ টাকার মতন, এরপর ১৩ তারিখে হয় ৬০ টাকা এবং একদিনে এক লাফে হয়ে যায় ৯০/১০০ টাকা। 

অনেক ট্রাক যেগুলোর এলসি অপেন করা হয়েছিল, সেরকম ট্রাক বর্ডারে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। বাংলাদেশ ভারত থেকে বছরে ৩৫০,০০০ টন পেয়াঁজ আমদানী  করে। ২০১৯ সালে পেয়াঁজের দাম প্রায় ৩০০ টাকার উপরে বেড়ে গিয়েছিল। 

কমার্স সেক্রেটারী মোহাম্মদ জাফর উদ্দিন । আমাদের লক্ষ্য খুব কম সময়ে আমদানী করা। আমরা ১ লাখ টন আমদানী করব তুরষ্ক এবং অন্য দেশ থেকে। 

ভারতে পেয়াঁজের দাম প্রায় ৩০ রুপীতে যেয়ে ঠেকেছে। গ্রীষ্মে যেই পেয়াঁজের ফলন হয়েছে কর্ণাটক এবং অন্ধ্র প্রদেশে তা বৃষ্টিপাতের কারণে ক্ষতি হয়েছে। এ বছরের জুন থেকে মৌসুমী বৃষ্টিতে ভারতে গত বছরের চেয়ে ৪১ ভাগ বেশী বৃষ্টিপাত হয়েছে।

গত বছর কার্গো প্লেনে তুরষ্ক থেকে মিশর থেকে পেয়াঁজ আনা হয়। দেখা গেলো সিজনের শেষে এক বড় অংশ পেয়াজ পচে গেল। ভারত গত রোববার সেপ্টেম্বরের  ১৩ তারিখে ঘোষণা করলো রপ্তানী বন্ধ, সেই দিনই কেজিতে ১৫/২০ টাকা বেড়ে গেলো। মঙ্গলবারের মধ্যে দাম লোকাল পেয়াজের ৮০ টাকা আর ভারতীঈয় ৭০/৭৫ টাকা। কর্তৃপক্ষ বলছে এইবার ফলন বেশী। গত বছরে বাড়তি ছিল বলছে নাম্বার দেখিয়ে। কিন্তু শেষ মেষ কি হলো ৩০০ টাকা কেজি। 

 আমরা কি ভুল সংখ্যা নিয়ে ডিল করছি? প্রতিবছরের উৎপাদন মোটামুটি একই রকম থাকার কথা। সামান্য এদিক ওদিক বিরাট দামে পার্থক্য করার কথা না। লেখক একই কথা বলছে একই ভুল করছে । আগে কেনা ছিল কম দামে, কেন এখন এক লাফে ১৫/২০ বাড়বে। এটাকে ক্রিমিনাল অফেন্স বলছে। গাধা কোথাকার।

Onions retail at four times the import price

https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/onions-retail-four-times-the-import-price-1963257

The Khulna-based Sundarban Enterprise received a consignment of 157 tonnes of onion at Bhomra land port on 14 September. It came from AA Enterprise of India. The import price is Tk 25.70 per kg, according to customs documents.

The consignment was part of 45,695 tonnes of onion worth Tk 78.24 crore that were imported from the neighbouring country through Hili, Sona Masjid, Bhomra and Benapole in the first 14 days of September. The average price is Tk 17.16.

The onion came in 601 consignments by around 100 importers. In August, 34,155 tonnes of onion worth Tk 47.28 crore were imported from India through the four land ports. Average import price stood at Tk 13.87.

But the root vegetable was retailed at Tk 90 to Tk 100 per kg in the kitchen markets in Chattogram yesterday, doubling from Tk 50 three days earlier.

During a visit to Khatunganj, the largest wholesale market in the country, yesterday, it was found that most of wholesalers in the port city are not selling the item in hopes that the price would go up further.

The price of onion has increased from Tk 35-40 to Tk 80-90 per kg in three days at the Khatunganj wholesale market.

Mintu Sawdagar, a wholesaler in Khatunganj, said wholesalers sell onions at the price fixed by importers and they get 2 to 3 per cent in commission.

According to Asaduzzaman, an importer and proprietor of Shah Amanat Traders, if there is a crisis in the market, then the import price does not become a big deal.

"The demand suddenly increased due to the fear of a price hike," he said, adding that the same happens when supply exceeds demand when items have to be sold at a much lower rate than they are imported at.

Around 15-20 per cent of total onion gets rotten on its way to the local market, he said.

Many traders have opened letters of credit to import onion from China, Egypt, Pakistan, the Netherlands and Myanmar in the last few days. The price would stabilise after two to three weeks when the new consignments arrive, according to importers.

They say onion price has risen by $100-120 per tonne to $460 to $480 in the international market after India banned exports.

The import price of the upcoming consignments would be Tk 41 to Tk 44 per kg. The transport cost would add another Tk 3 to Tk 7 per kg before they become available in the wholesale market, they said.

Twenty-five traders have submitted documents to import 58,000 tonnes of onion from China, Egypt, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Myanmar, Turkey, Thailand and New Zealand, according to data from the Plant Quarantine Centre at the Chattogram Port.

The onion will be arriving in the port by the beginning of October.

India on Monday prohibited exports of onion as prices trebled in a month after excessive rainfall hit crops in southern states.

Wholesale prices in India's largest onion trading hub, Lasalgaon in the western state of Maharashtra, have nearly trebled in a month to $408.52 per tonne, Reuters reported.

Bangladesh's annual onion production capacity has been steady at 17-18 lakh tonnes for the last three years but a further 11 lakh tonnes had to be imported each year during that time as well to meet the supply deficit, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.

Imports declined 33 per cent year-on-year to 8 lakh tonnes in the first nine months of the ongoing fiscal year, the BBS data showed. India is the biggest supplier of onions to Bangladesh.

In September last year, India also imposed a ban on the export of onions, prompting the price of the kitchen staple to reach to as high as Tk 250 per kg in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh to import 11,000 tons of onion from 5 countries
 Anwar Hussain, Chittagong

 Traders initiated the process of importing onions from alternative countries well ahead of the ban on onion exports slapped by India.

So far, the traders have taken permission from the authorities concerned to import 11,000 tons of onions from five countries.

Dr Md Ashaduzzaman Bulbul, deputy director of Chittagong Plant Quarantine Station (Sea Port), confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune on Tuesday.

Getting hint of a possible export ban by India, the traders of the country initiated the process well ahead to import onions from alternative countries.

They began the process of taking import permission from September 3.

According to the information provided by Chittagong Plant Quarantine Station (Sea Port), 24 enterprises have so far taken permission for importing 10,091 metric tons of onions from China, Myanmar, Pakistan, Egypt, and Turkey.

Dr Md Ashaduzzaman Bulbul told Dhaka Tribune that they were avoiding delays in issuing the import permit (IP) in order to release the imported onions as quickly as possible.

The ban on onion export slapped by India has already triggered a price hike in both wholesale and retail markets in Chittagong.

However, prices shot up to Tk55 to Tk60 per kilogram at the commodity hub on Tuesday.

Visiting various kitchen markets of the port city, it was found that onions imported from India retailed at Tk50 per kg on Monday.

However, the price jumped to Tk70, after just one day on Tuesday.

On Monday, India banned exports of all varieties of onions with immediate effect to cap its rising prices in the domestic market.

Like the previous year, floods have ruined most of India's onion production, prompting the supply crunch.

On September 29 last year, India imposed a ban on the export of onions to Bangladesh due to a price hike of the item in its domestic market.

The restriction fuelled up onion prices in Bangladesh almost overnight, skyrocketing to Tk250 per kilogram.

India had lifted the prohibition on March 15 this year.

Onion price on upward trend as India maintains export ban

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2020/09/17/onion-price-on-upward-trend-as-india-maintains-export-ban

India on Monday prohibited the export of all varieties of onion except in cut, sliced or powdered form


Onion importers, who use Hili port for importing from India, said import of onion remained on halt on Thursday as Delhi maintained the ban on onion export to Bangladesh.

Even though there were assurances of receiving old onion consignments stuck outside the Hili land port prior to the ban, local onion importers did not receive the necessary approval for the procurement.

Around 250-300 onion-laden trucks became stuck in India waiting to enter Bangladesh, said Haroon Ur Rashid, president of the Hili Land Port Import-Export Group. The onion will rot if the vehicles remain stranded, he said.

Besides, importers have opened letters of credit (LC) for procuring about 10,000 tons of onion from India, which is now uncertain, Rashid said.

As a result, onion price has shot up by Tk10-15 per kg and the bulb is being sold at Tk65-70 per kg in the port market as soon as news of India’s export ban spread.

India on Monday prohibited the export of all varieties of onion except in cut, sliced or powdered form.

Shankar Das, C&F agent for the Indian part of the port, said the Department of Foreign Trade of the Government of India issued a notification announcing the ban on Monday evening. Onion export to Bangladesh will be stopped until further notice.

He said the destruction of onion in recent floods in India and supply crunch have pushed up the prices. “The government’s move is aimed at controlling the prices in the local market,” he said.

Anil Thakur, an Indian exporter, said the Indian government decided to ban the export of onion to keep the onion prices normal in India. So, the customs immediately stopped any import of onions, including the trucks that were already loaded with onions to go to Bangladesh.

Last year, India banned onion export without prior notice, pushing up prices of the bulb in Bangladesh to record heights.

Onion markets heat up across the country

The ban on onion export slapped by India has triggered price hikes in Chittagong, Hili, and Chapainawabganj as well.

In Chittagong, according to Khatunganj market wholesalers, Indian onions sold at Tk38-40 per kg on Monday but it shot up to Tk55-Tk70 per kg on Tuesday.

Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, General Secretary of Khatunganj Hamid Ullah Market Traders' Welfare Association Mohammad Idris said the price would hover around the existing ranges for the next week or two.

“No onions have been imported from Myanmar through the Teknaf border due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation. Prices will drop further with imports from Myanmar and other countries,” he said.

In June, July, and August this year, 1,082 metric tons of onions imported from China and Myanmar entered through the Chittagong seaport.

In Chapainawabganj, a similar situation was found as onion trucks did not enter the Sonamasjid land port on Tuesday morning.

2020/09/unnamed-1599980876619.gif
About 200 trucks carrying onions are stuck in Mohaddipur, India. As a result, the importers of the country may face losses.

Bablu Hasanat Durul, an onion importer from the area, said: "With the opportunity to import onions from other countries and the stock of domestic onions, India's decision should not increase the price of onions in the country's market like last time."

Mesbahul Haque Mesba, former general secretary of the Sonamasjid Land Port C&F Agents Association, said that even though 44 Indian onion carts entered the port on Monday, no onion truck entered the port on Tuesday.

Onion traders fined across the country

Local authorities have penalized onion traders across the country for selling onions at a higher price.

In Dinajpur, three onion traders were fined Tk2,000 by Nawabganj upazila Assistant Commissioner (Land) and Executive Magistrate Al Mamun.

He said: “Onion traders were selling onions at Tk100-120 per kg instead of Tk50. After learning about this, we conducted a drive in the local market and fined three of them.”

In Benapole, three more onion traders were penalised Tk30,000 by a mobile court.

Sharsha upazila Executive Officer Pulok Kumar Mandal conducted the mobile court on Tuesday.

In Lakshmipur, a mobile court fined two wholesalers Tk6,000 for selling onions at a higher price and failing to show invoices.

The mobile court was conducted by Additional District Magistrate Abu Wadud on Tuesday.

In Brahmanbaria, a mobile court fined two traders for selling onions at a higher price.

The mobile court conducted by Kasba upazila Assistant Commissioner (Land) and Executive Magistrate Hasiba Khanom, fined one wholesaler Tk5,000 and another Tk3,000 in this regard.

On Monday, the Indian government prohibited the export of all varieties of onions yet again. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade, under the Commerce Ministry of India, issued a notification on Monday to this end.

On September 29, last year, India imposed a similar ban on the export of onion to Bangladesh due to a price hike of the item in its domestic market. The price of the kitchen item had shot up to Tk300 a kilogram in Bangladesh. Later, India had lifted the ban on March 15 this year.

However, the market became volatile again at the beginning of September since the onion harvest season ended and the supply faced shortage due to floods.

Onion price hike brings tears to Bangladeshi eyes

https://www.arabnews.com/node/1735731/world

My family needs around two kilograms of onions per week. If the current situation prevails, it will increase my expenses a lot. It’s an extra financial burden on our family of five,” Begum said. 

A similar ban by India on Sept. 30 last year lifted prices to $3 per kilogram.

To maintain supplies, Bangladesh has started importing onions from Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt.

However, the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, a wing of the Commerce Ministry that works to maintain supplies of essential commodities, said it had beefed up operations to control the market price.  “We have started selling onions at a reduced price through open market sales across the country. Every day, 276 trucks deliver the goods in different localities so that people can buy at an affordable price,” a spokesman told Arab News.

Onion export ban is not the answer — it hurts farmers & India’s image as a reliable exporter
Onion prices have already risen due to heavy rain and crop damage, and could hurt consumers reeling due to income loss in the Covid-induced lockdown.
ILA PATNAIK and RADHIKA PANDEY 18 September, 2020 8:17 am IST


The central government recently issued a notification banning the export of onions. The trigger for this move was that the wholesale price of onion has seen a steady increase over the last two months — in retail markets, the price is now around Rs 35-40 per kg, as against Rs 25-30 per kg in June.

The recent rise in prices is mainly due to heavy rains in August that have affected the almost market-ready onion crop in Karnataka, which was supposed to hit markets in early September. While Indian onions are routinely exported to countries in the Gulf, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the demand from Sri Lanka has picked up due to destruction of its own crops due to rains.

A supply crunch in the domestic market would cause a rise in CPI food inflation and would hurt consumers who are already reeling under the impact of the Covid-induced lockdown that sharply affected their incomes. The move is intended to provide relief to households who are sensitive to changes in price of onions. But while the ban favours consumers, it hurts farmers’ interests.

While these are all steps in the right direction, the onion export ban has caused unrest among farmers as it hurts their interests. Onion prices are highly volatile. While farmers suffer during excess supply and depressed prices, they are unable to reap the benefits of higher prices amid crop shortages and a surge in demand in the international market if price caps are imposed or exports are banned. Since supply is lower, the total income of farmers falls when the crop is destroyed. Higher prices would have allowed them to make up some of the loss in income.

 the primary source of arbitrary and unpredictable restrictions is the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992. The preamble of the act states that its purpose is to augment exports, but it gives powers to the central government to prohibit, regulate and restrict export of goods.

Between 2014 and 2019 (five years), the government changed the rules on onion export 17 times, more than three times a year on average. Farmers who export have no stable legal regime. This is inimical to India’s image as a stable and reliable exporter of onions.
