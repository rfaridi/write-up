Since the pandemic started the major focus of the discussion was on how to save the poor. So the focus on whether we have a list of people with poverty or not. For example India has a list of "Aadhar card hoders" or "Janadhan" card holders. But Bangladesh has none such as that. The thing is that Bangladesh actually started to work on that from 2013 but it did not work out. Initially the budget was 315 crore and the completition target was 2017. But now we are learning that budget has doubled and work will be not pending before 2021. 

This leaves us with a strange dilemma. How come do we actually manage to help the poor. Two enlightening articles on this recently surfaced which piqued my interest. Two by the same author. According to author's forceful arguments, we really do not need to target the poor. Poverty is a everchanging situation, it really can not be tracked. Someone who is poor today might not be poor tomorrow. If a person's son gets a job next month, they may lift themselves up from the poverty trap. On the other hand, if someone faced a disaster might be falling into a poverty instantly. 

So it is futile to track the poor. Rather much prudent would be to go for universal coverage. But the coverage mechanism would be such that the targeteded group will be more willing to go the extra mile whereas the rich will self-include and part of the middle class will be going into the program. The poor will definitely go no doubt. 

In light of this discussion it would seem that the recent study but PPRC-BIGD seems invalid. They took a sample from the 2016-17 of 24,283 slum HHs in 35 slums across 9 districts across the country.Rural was mentioned as 26,925 HHs across 64 districts. 

With such transitory nature of poor it is futile to continue to targeting the poor. This study uses lists from 4 years back which will not be useful. Therefore the studies they are mentioning are really not useful.
